<h3 class="hang"><i>An Impartial Account of the most Memorable
Matters of Fact, touching the supposed
Witchcraft in</i> New-England.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><i> Matters of Fact.</i></div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. <i>Parris</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> had been some years a Minister
in <i>Salem-Village</i>, when this sad Calamity
(as a deluge) overflowed them, spreading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
itself far and near. He was a Gentleman of Liberal
Education, and not meeting with any great Encouragement,
or Advantage in Merchandizing, to
which for some time he apply'd himself, betook
himself to the work of the Ministry; this Village
being then vacant, he met with so much
Encouragement, as to settle in that Capacity
among them.</p>

<p>After he had been there about two years, he
obtained a Grant from a part of the Town, that
the House and Land he Occupied, and which
had been Alotted by the whole People to the
Ministry, should be and remain to him, <i>&amp;c.</i> as
his own Estate in Fee Simple. This occasioned
great <i>Divisions</i> both between the Inhabitants
themselves, and between a considerable part of
them and their said Minister, which Divisions
were but as a beginning or <i>Præludium</i> to what
immediately followed.</p>

<p>It was the latter end of <i>February</i> 1691,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> when
divers young Persons belonging to Mr. <i>Parris's</i>
Family, and one or more of the Neighbourhood,
began to [91] Act, after a strange &amp; unusual
manner, <i>viz.</i> as by getting into Holes, and creeping
under Chairs and Stools, and to use sundry
odd Postures and Antick Gestures, uttering foolish,
ridiculous Speeches, which neither they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>themselves nor any others could make sense of;
the Physicians<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> that were called could assign no
reason for this; but it seems one of them, having
recourse to the old shift, told them he was
afraid they were Bewitched; upon such suggestions,
they that were concerned, applied themselves
to Fasting and Prayer, which was attended
not only in their own private Families, but with
calling in the help of others.</p>

<p><i>March</i> the 11<i>th</i>. Mr. <i>Parris</i> invited several
Neighbouring Ministers to join with him in
keeping a Solemn day of Prayer at his own
House; the time of the exercise those Persons
were for the most part silent, but after any one
Prayer was ended, they would Act and Speak
strangely and Ridiculously, yet were such as had
been well Educated and of good Behaviour, the
one a Girl of 11 or 12 years old, would sometimes
seem to be in a <i>Convulsion</i> Fit, her Limbs
being twisted several ways, and very stiff, but
presently her Fit would be over.</p>

<p>A few days before this Solemn day of Prayer,
Mr. <i>Parris's</i> <i>Indian</i> Man and Woman made a
Cake of Rye Meal, with the Childrens Water,
and Baked it in the Ashes, and as is said, gave it
to the Dog; this was done as a means to Discover
Witchcraft; soon after which those ill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>affected or afflicted Persons named several that
they said they saw, when in their Fits, afflicting
of them.</p>

<p>The first complain'd of, was the said <i>Indian</i>
Woman, named <i>Tituba</i>,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> she confessed that the
<i>Devil</i> urged her to sign a Book, which he presented
to her, and also to work Mischief to the
Children, <i>&amp;c.</i> She was afterwards Committed
to Prison, and lay there till Sold for her Fees.
The account she since gives of it is, that her
Master did beat her and otherways abuse her, to
make her confess and accuse (such as he call'd)
her Sister-Witches, and that whatsoever she said
by way of confessing or accusing others, was the
effect of such usage; her Master refused to pay
her Fees, unless she would stand to what she had
said.</p>

<p>The Children complained likewise of two
other Women, to be the Authors of their Hurt,
<i>Viz.</i> <i>Sarah Good</i>, who had long been counted a
<i>Melancholy</i> or <i>Distracted</i> Woman, and one <i>Osburn</i>,
an Old <i>Bed-rid</i> Women, which two were Persons
so ill thought of, that the accusation was the
more readily believed; and after Examination
before two <i>Salem</i> Magistrates were committed:<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span><i>March</i> the 19<i>th</i>, Mr. <i>Lawson</i> (who had been formerly
a Preacher at the said Village) came thither,
and hath since set forth in Print an account of
what then passed, about which time, as he saith,
they complained of Goodwife <i>Cory</i>, and Goodwife
<i>Nurse</i>, Members of Churches at the Village,
and at <i>Salem</i>, many others being by that time
Accused.</p>

<p><i>March</i> the 21<i>st</i>, Goodwife <i>Cory</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> was examined
before the Magistrates of <i>Salem</i>, at the Meeting
House in the Village, a throng of Spectators being
present to see the Novelty. Mr. <i>Noyes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> one of
the Ministers of <i>Salem</i> began with Prayer, after
which the Prisoner being call'd, in order to answer
to what [92] should be Alledged against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>her, she desired that she might go to Prayer, and
was answered by the Magistrates, that they did
not come to hear her pray, but to examine her.</p>

<p>The number of the Afflicted were at that time
about Ten, <i>Viz.</i> Mrs. <i>Pope</i>, Mrs. <i>Putman</i>, goodwife
<i>Bibber</i>,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and Goodwife <i>Goodall</i>, <i>Mary Wolcott</i>,
<i>Mercy Lewes</i> (at <i>Thomas Putmans</i>) and Dr.
<i>Griggs</i> Maid, and three Girls, <i>Viz.</i> <i>Elizabeth Parris</i>,
Daughter to the Minister, <i>Abigail Williams</i>
his Neice, and <i>Ann Putman</i>, which last three,
were not only the beginners, but were also the
chief in these Accusations.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> These Ten were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>most of them present at the Examination, and
did vehemently accuse her of Afflicting them, by
Biting, Pinching, Strangling, &amp;c. And they said,
they did in their Fits see her likeness coming to
them, and bringing a Book for them to Sign;
Mr. <i>Hathorn</i>, a Magistrate of <i>Salem</i>, asked her, why
she Afflicted those Children? she said, she did not
Afflict them, he asked her who did then? she
said, I do not know, how should I know? she
said, they were Poor Distracted Creatures, and no
heed to be given to what they said; Mr. <i>Hathorn</i>
and Mr. <i>Noyes</i> replied that it was the Judgment
of all that were there present, that they were
bewitched, and only she (the Accused) said they
were Distracted: She was Accused by them, that
the <i>Black Man</i> Whispered to her in her Ear now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
(while she was upon Examination) and that she
had a Yellow Bird, that did use to Suck between
her Fingers, and that the said Bird did Suck now
in the Assembly; order being given to look in
that place to see if there were any sign, the Girl
that pretended to see it said, that it was too late
now, for she had removed a Pin, and put it on
her Head, it was upon search found, that a Pin
was there sticking upright. When the Accused
had any motion of their Body, Hands or Mouth,
the Accusers would cry out, as when she bit a
Lip, they would cry out of being bitten, if she
grasped one hand with the other, they would cry
out of being Pinched by her, and would produce
marks, so of the other motions of her Body, as
complaining of being Prest, when she lean'd to
the seat next her, if she stirred her Feet, they
would stamp and cry out of Pain there. After
the hearing the said <i>Cory</i> was committed to
<i>Salem</i> Prison, and then their crying out of her
abated.</p>

<p><i>March</i> the 24<i>th</i>, Goodwife <i>Nurse</i> was brought
before Mr. <i>Hathorn</i> and Mr. <i>Curwin</i> (Magistrates)
in the Meeting House, Mr. <i>Hale</i> Minister of
<i>Beverly</i>, began with Prayer, after which she being
Accus'd of much the same Crimes made the like
answers, asserting her own Innocence with earnestness.
The Accusers were mostly the same,
<i>Tho Putmans</i> Wife, <i>&amp;c.</i> complaining much. The
dreadful Shreiking from her and others, was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
amazing, which was heard at a great distance;
she was also Committed to Prison.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>A Child of <i>Sarah Goods</i>, was likewise apprehended,
being between 4 and 5 years Old, the
Accusers said this Child bit them, and would
shew such like marks, as those of a small Sett of
Teeth upon their Arms, as many of the Afflicted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>as the Child cast its Eye upon, would complain
they were in Torment; which Child they also
Committed.</p>

<p>Concerning these that had been hitherto Examined
and Committed, it is [93] among other
things observed, by Mr. <i>Lawson</i> (in Print<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>) that
they were by the Accusers charged, to belong to
a Company that did muster in Arms, and were
reported by them to keep Days of Fast, Thanksgiving
and Sacraments; and that those Afflicted
(or Accusers) did in the Assembly, Cure each
other, even with a touch of their hand, when
strangled and otherways tortured, and would endeavour
to get to the Afflicted to relieve them
thereby (for hitherto they had not used the Experiment
of bringing the Accused to touch the
Afflicted, in order to their Cure) and could foretell
one anothers Fits to be coming, and would
say, look to such a one, she will have a Fit presently
and so it happened, and that at the same
time when the Accused person was present, the
Afflicted said they saw her <i>Spectre</i> or likeness in
other places of the Meeting House Sucking [suckling]
their Familiars.</p>

<p>The said Mr. <i>Lawson</i> being to Preach at the
Village, after the Psalm was Sung, <i>Abigail Williams</i>
said, <i>Now Stand up and name your Text</i>; after it was
read, she said, <i>It is a long Text</i>. Mrs. Pope in the
beginning of Sermon said to him, <i>Now there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>enough of that</i>. In Sermon, he referring to his
Doctrine, <i>Abigail Williams</i> said to him, <i>I know no
Doctrine you had, if you did name one I have forgot
it</i>. <i>Ann Putman</i> an afflicted Girl, said, <i>There was
a Yellow Bird sate on his Hat as it hung on the Pin
in the Pulpit</i>.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p><i>March</i> 31, 1692. Was set apart as a day of Solem
Humiliation at <i>Salem</i>, upon the Account of
this Business, on which day <i>Abigail Williams</i> said,
<i>That she saw a great number of Persons in the Village
at the Administration of a Mock Sacrament,
where they had Bread as read as raw Flesh, and red
Drink</i>.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><i>April</i> 1. <i>Mercy Lewis</i> affirmed, <i>That she saw a
man in White, with whom she went into a Glorious
Place</i>, viz. in her fits, <i>where was no Light of the
Sun, much less of Candles, yet was full of Light and
Brightness, with a great Multitude in White Glittering
Robes, who Sang the Song in</i> Rev. v. 9. <i>and
the</i> cx. <i>and</i> cxlix. Psalms; <i>And was given that she
mighty tarry no longer in this place</i>. This White
Man is said to have appeared several times to
others of them, and to have given them notice
how long it should be before they should have
another Fit.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><i>April</i> the 3<i>d</i>. Being Sacrament Day at the Village,
<i>Sarah Cloys</i>, Sister to Goodwife <i>Nurse</i>, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>Member of one of the Churches, was (tho' it
seems with difficulty prevailed with to be) present;
but being entred the place, and Mr. <i>Parris</i>
naming his Text, <i>John</i> vi. 70. <i>Have not I
chosen you Twelve, and one of you is a Devil</i> (for
what cause may rest as a doubt whether upon the
account of her Sisters being committed, or because
of the choice of that Text) she rose up and
went out, the wind shutting the Door forcibly,
gave occasion to some to suppose she went out in
Anger, and might occasion a suspicion of her;
However she was soon after complain'd of, examin'd
and committed.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><i>April</i> the 11<i>th</i>. By this time the number of
the Accused and Accusers being much increased,
was a Public Examination at <i>Salem</i>, Six of the
Magistrates with several Ministers being present,
there appeared several who complain'd against
others with hidious clamors and Screechings.
Goodwife <i>Proctor</i><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> was brought thither, being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
Accused or cryed out against; her Hus[94]band
coming to attend and assist her, as there might
be need, the Accusers cryed out of him also, and
that with so much earnestness, that he was Committed
with his Wife. About this time besides
the Experiment of the Afflicted falling at the
sight, <i>&amp;c.</i> they put the Accused upon saying the
Lord's Prayer, which one among them performed,
except in that petition [<i>Deliver us from Evil</i>] she
exprest it thus (<i>Deliver us from all Evil</i>) this was
lookt upon as if she Prayed against what she was
now justly under, and being put upon it again,
and repeating those words [<i>Hallowed be thy name</i>]
she exprest it [<i>Hollowed be thy Name</i>] this was
counted a depraving the words, as signifying to
make void, and so a Curse rather than a Prayer,
upon the whole it was concluded that she also
could not say it, <i>&amp;c.</i> Proceeding in this work
of examination and Commitment many were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>

<p class="p2">The occasion of <i>Bishops</i> being cry'd out of, was
he being at an Examination in <i>Salem</i>, when at the
Inn an afflicted <i>Indian</i> was very unruly, whom he
undertook, and so managed him, that he was very
orderly, after which in riding home, in company
of him and other Accusers, the <i>Indian</i> fell into a
fit, and clapping hold with his Teeth on the back
of the Man that rode before him, thereby held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
himself upon the Horse, but said, <i>Bishop</i> striking
him with his stick, the <i>Indian</i> soon recovered,
and promised he would do so no more; to which
<i>Bishop</i> replied, that he [95] doubted not, but he
could cure them all, with more to the same effect;
immediately after he was parted from them, he
was cried out of, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p><i>May</i> 14, 1692. Sir <i>William Phips</i> arrived with
Commission from their Majesties to be Governor,
pursuant to the New Charter; which he now
brought with him; the Ancient Charter having
been vacated by King <i>Charles</i>, and King James
(by which they had a power not only to make
their own Laws; but also to chuse their own
Governor and Officers;) and the Countrey for some
years was put under an absolute Commission-Government,
till the Revolution, at which time,
tho more than two thirds of the People were for
reassuming their ancient Government, (to which
they had encouragement by his then Royal Highness's
Proclamation) yet some that might have
been better imployed<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> (in another Station) made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>it their business (by printing, as well as speaking)
to their utmost to divert them from such a settlement;
and so far prevailed, that for about seven
Weeks after the Revolution, here was not so
much as a face of any Government; but some
few Men upon their own Nomination would be
called a Committee of Safety; but at length the
Assembly prevailed with those that had been of
the Government, to promise that they would reassume;
and accordingly a Proclamation was
drawn, but before publishing it, it was underwritten,
that they would not have it understood
that they did reassume Charter-Government; so
that between Government and no Government,
this Countrey remained till Sir <i>William</i> arrived:
Agents being in this time impowered in <i>England</i>,
which no doubt did not all of them act according
to the Minds or Interests of those that impowered
them, which is manifest by their not acting
jointly in what was done; so that this place is
perhaps a single Instance (even in the best of
Reigns) of a Charter not restored after so happy
a Revolution.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
This settlement by Sir <i>William Phips</i> his being
come Governour put an end to all disputes of
these things,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and being arrived, and having read
his Commission, the first thing he exerted his
Power in, was said to be his giving Orders that
Irons should be put upon those in Prison; for
tho for sometime after these were Committed,
the Accusers ceased to cry out of them; yet now
the cry against them was renewed, which occasioned
such Order; and tho there was partiality
in the executing it (some having taken them off
almost as soon as put on) yet the cry of these
Accusers against such ceased after this Order.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><i>May</i> 24. Mrs. <i>Cary</i> of <i>Charlestown</i>, was Examined
and Committed. Her Husband Mr. <i>Nathaniel
Cary</i> has given account thereof, as also
of her Escape, to this Effect,</p>

<p><i>I having heard some days, that my Wife was accused
of Witchcraft, being much disturbed at it, by
advice, we went to</i> Salem-Village, <i>to see if the
af</i>[96]<i>flicted knew her; we arrived there, 24. May,
it happened to be a day appointed for Examination;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>accordingly soon after our arrival,</i> Mr. Hathorn
<i>and</i> Mr. Curwin, &amp;c. <i>went to the Meeting-house,
which was the place appointed for that Work, the
Minister began with Prayer, and having taken care
to get a convenient place, I observed, that the afflicted
were two Girls of about Ten Tears old, and
about two or three other, of about eighteen, one of
the girls talked most, and could discern more than the
rest. The Prisoners were called in one by one, and
as they came in were cried out of, &amp;c. The Prisoner
was placed about 7 or 8 foot from the Justices,
and the Accusers between the Justices and them;
the Prisoner was ordered to stand right before the
Justices, with an Officer appointed to hold each hand,
least they should therewith afflict them, and the Prisoner's
Eyes must be constantly on the Justices; for if
they look'd on the afflicted, they would either fall into
their Fits, or cry out of being hurt by them; after
Examination of the Prisoners, who it was afflicted
these Girls, &amp;c. they were put upon saying the
Lord's Prayer, as a tryal of their guilt; after the
afflicted seem'd to be out of their Fits, they would
look steadfastly on some one person, and frequently not
speak; and then the Justices said they were struck
dumb, and after a little time would speak again;
then the Justices said to the Accusers, which of you
will go and touch the Prisoner at the Bar? then
the most courageous would adventure, but before they
had made three steps would ordinarily fall down as
in a Fit; the Justices ordered that they should be
taken up and carried to the Prisoner, that she might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
touch them; and as soon as they were touched by the
accused, the Justices would say, they are well, before
I could discern any alteration; by which I observed
that the Justices understood the manner of it. Thus
far I was only as a Spectator, my Wife also was
there part of the time, but no notice taken of her by
the afflicted, except once or twice they came to her
and asked her name.</i></p>

<p><i>But I having an opportunity to Discourse</i> Mr.
Hale <i>(with whom I had formerly acquaintance)</i> I
<i>took his advice, what I had best to do, and desired of
him that I might have an opportunity to speak with
her that accused my Wife; which he promised
should be, I acquainting him that I reposed my trust
in him.</i></p>

<p><i>Accordingly he came to me after the Examination
was over, and told me I had now an opportunity to
speak with the said Accuser,</i> viz. Abigail Williams,
<i>a Girl of</i> 11 <i>or</i> 12 <i>Years old; but that we could
not be in private at Mr.</i> Parris's <i>House, as he had
promised me; we went therefore into the Alehouse,
where an Indian man attended us, who it seems was
one of the afflicted: to him we gave some Cyder, he
shewed several Scars, that seemed as if they had been
long there, and shewed them as done by Witchcraft,
and acquainted us that his Wife, who also was a
Slave, was imprison'd for Witchcraft.</i><a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> <i>And now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>instead of one Accuser, they all came in, who began
to tumble down like Swine, and then three Women
were called in to attend them. We in the Room
were all at a stand, to see who they would cry out
of; but in a short time they cried</i> [97] <i>out,</i> Cary:
<i>and immediately after a Warrant was sent from the
Justices to bring my Wife before them, who were
sitting in a Chamber near by, waiting for this.</i></p>

<p><i>Being brought before the Justices, her chief accusers
were two Girls: my Wife declared to the
Justices, that she never had any knowledge of them
before that day; she was forced to stand with her
Arms stretched out. I did request that I might hold
one of her hands, but it was denied me; then she
desired me to wipe the Tears from her Eyes, and the
Sweat from her Face, which I did; then she desired
she might lean herself on me, saying, she should faint.</i></p>

<p>Justice Hathorn <i>replied, she had strength enough
to torment those persons, and she should have strength
enough to stand. I speaking something against their
cruel proceedings, they commanded me to be silent, or
else I should be turned out of the Room. The Indian
before mentioned, was also brought in to be one of her
Accusers: being come in, he now (when before the
Justices) fell down and tumbled about like a Hog,
but said nothing. The Justices asked the Girls,
who afflicted the Indian? they answered she (meaning
my wife) and now lay upon him; the Justices
ordered her to touch him, in order to his cure, but
her head must be turned another way, least instead of
curing, she should make him worse, by her looking on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
him, her hand being guided to take hold of his; but
the Indian took hold on her hand, and pulled her
down on the Floor, in a barbarous manner; then his
hand was taken off, and her hand put on his, and the
cure was quickly wrought. I being extreamly troubled
at their Inhumane dealings, uttered a hasty
Speech</i> [That God would take vengeance on them,
and desired that God would deliver us out of the
hands of unmerciful men.] <i>Then her Mittimus
was writ; I did with difficulty and charge obtain
the liberty of a Room, but no beds in it; if there
had, could have taken but little rest that Night, she
was committed to Boston Prison; but I obtained a
Habeas Corpus to remove her to Cambridge Prison,
which is in our County of Middlesex. Having been
there one Night, next Morning the Jaylor</i><a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
<i>put Irons on her legs (having received such a command)
the weight of them was about eight pounds; these
with her other Afflictions, soon brought her into Convulsion
Fits, so that I thought she would have died
that Night, I sent to intreat that the Irons might be
taken off, but all intreaties were in vain, if it would
have saved her Life, so that in this condition she
must continue. The Tryals at Salem coming on, I
went thither, to see how things were managed; and
finding that the Spectre-Evidence was there received,
together with Idle, if not Malicious stories, against
Peoples Lives, I did easily see which way it would
go; for the same Evidence that served for one, would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
serve for all the rest; I acquainted her with her
danger; and that if she were carried to Salem to be
tried, I feared she would never return. I did my
utmost that she might have her Tryal in our own
County, I with several others Petitioning the Judge
for it, and were put in hopes of it;</i> [98] <i>but I soon
saw so much, that I understood thereby it was not
intended, which put me upon consulting the means of
her escape; which thro the goodness of God was
effected, and she got to Road Island, but soon found
herself not safe when there, by reason of the pursuit
after her; from thence she went to New-York, along
with some others that had escaped their cruel hands;
where we found his Excellency</i> Benjamin Fletcher,
<i>Esq: Governour, who was very courteous to us. After
this some of my Goods were seized in a Friends
hands, with whom I had left them, and myself imprisoned
by the Sheriff, and kept in Custody half a
day, and then dismist; but to speak of their usage of
the Prisoners, and their Inhumanity shewn to them, at
the time of their Execution, no sober Christian could
bear; they had also tryals of cruel mockings; which
is the more, considering what a People for Religion,
I mean the profession of it, we have been; those that
suffered being many of them Church-Members, and
most of them unspotted in their Conversation, till
their Adversary the Devil took up this Method for
accusing them.</i></p>

<p class="dropcap">JOHN <span class="smcap">Aldin</span> Senior, <i>of Boston, in the County of

<i>was sent for by the Magistrates of</i> Salem, <i>in the County
of Essex, upon the Accusation of a company of poor

Gidney,<i> Mr.</i> Hathorn, <i>and Mr.</i> Curwin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
<i>Those Wenches being present, who plaid their
jugling tricks, falling down, crying out, and staring
in Peoples Faces; the Magistrates demanded of them
several times, who it was of all the People in the
Room that hurt them? one of these Accusers pointed
several times at one</i> Captain Hill,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> <i>there present,
but spake nothing; the same Accuser, had a Man
standing at her back to hold her up; he stooped down
to her Ear, then she cried out,</i> Aldin, Aldin <i>afflicted
her; one of the Magistrates asked her if she had
ever seen</i> Aldin, <i>she answered no, he asked how she
knew it was</i> Aldin? <i>She said, the Man told her so.</i></p>

<p><i>Then all were ordered to go down into the Street,
where a Ring was made; and the same Accuser
cried out, there stands</i> Aldin, <i>a bold fellow with his
Hat on before the Judges, he sells Powder and Shot
to the</i> Indians <i>and</i> French, [99] <i>and lies with the</i>
Indian <i>Squaes, and has</i> Indian <i>Papooses. Then
was</i> Aldin <i>committed to the Marshal's Custody, and
his Sword taken from him; for they said he afflicted
them with his Sword. After some hours</i> Aldin <i>was
sent for to the Meeting-house in the Village before
the Magistrates; who required</i> Aldin <i>to stand upon
a Chair, to the open view of all the People.</i></p>

<p><i>The Accusers cried out that</i> Aldin <i>did pinch them,
then, when he stood upon the Chair, in the sight of all
the People, a good way distant from them, one of the
Magistrates bid the Marshal to hold open</i> Aldins <i>hands,
that he might not pinch those Creatures.</i> Aldin
<i>asked them why they should think, that he should come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
to that Village to afflict those persons that he never
knew or saw before? Mr.</i> Gidney <i>bid</i> Aldin <i>confess,
and give glory to God:</i> Aldin <i>said he hoped he
should give glory to God, and hoped he should never
gratifie the Devil; but appealed to all that ever
knew him, if they ever suspected him to be such a
person, and challenged any one, that could bring in
any thing upon their own knowledge, that might give
suspicion of his being such an one. Mr.</i> Gidney
<i>said he had known</i> Aldin <i>many Years, and had been
at Sea with him, and always look'd upon him to be
an honest Man, but now he did see cause to alter his
judgment:</i> Aldin <i>answered, he was sorry for that,
but he hoped God would clear up his Innocency, that
he would recall that judgment again, and added that
he hoped that he should with</i> Job <i>maintain his Integrity
till he died. They bid</i> Aldin <i>look upon the
Accusers, which he did, and then they fell down.</i>
Aldin <i>asked Mr.</i> Gidney, <i>what reason there could
be given, why</i> Aldin's <i>looking upon him did not
strike him down as well? but no reason was given
that I heard. But the Accusers were brought to</i>
Aldin <i>to touch them, and this touch they said made
them well.</i> Aldin <i>began to speak of the Providence
of God, in suffering these Creatures to accuse Innocent
persons; Mr.</i> Noyes <i>asked</i> Aldin <i>why he would
offer to speak of the Providence of God, God by his
Providence (said Mr.</i> Noyes) <i>governs the World,
and keeps it in peace; and so went on with Discourse,
and stopt Aldin's mouth, as to that.</i> Aldin <i>told Mr.</i>
Gidney, <i>that he could assure him that there was a

at the sight, and rising at the touch of the Accused,
is no infallible proof of guilt; That seeing
the Devils strength consists in such Accusations,
our disbelieving them may be a means to put a
period to the dreadful Calamities; Nevertheless
they humbly recommend to the Government, the
speedy and vigorous prosecution of such as have
rendered themselves obnoxious, according to the
direction given in the Laws of God, and the
wholesome Statutes of the <i>English</i> Nation, for
the Detection of Witchcraft.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

This is briefly the substance of what may be
seen more at large in <i>Cases of Conscience</i>, (<i>ult.</i>)
And one of them since taking occasion to repeat
some part of this advice, <i>Wonders</i> of the <i>Invisible
World</i>, p. 83. declares, (notwithstanding the Dissatisfaction
of others) that if his said Book may
conduce to promote thankfulness to God for such
Executions, he shall rejoice, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The 30th of <i>June</i>, the Court according to Adjournment
again sat; five more were tried, <i>viz.</i>
<i>Sarah Good</i> and <i>Rebecca Nurse</i>, of <i>Salem-Village</i>;
<i>Susanna Martin</i> of <i>Amsbury</i>; <i>Elizabeth How</i> of
<i>Ipswich</i>; and <i>Sarah Wildes</i> of <i>Topsfield</i>: these
were all condemned that Sessions, and were all
Executed on the 19th of <i>July</i>.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>At the Tryal of <i>Sarah Good</i>, one of the afflicted
fell in a Fit, and after coming out of it, she cried
out of the Prisoner, for stabbing her in the breast
with a Knife, and that she had broken the Knife
in stabbing of her, accordingly a piece of the
blade of a Knife was found about her. Immediately
information being given to the Court, a
young Man was called, who produced a Haft
and part of the Blade, which the Court having
viewed and compared, saw it to be the same.
And upon inquiry the young Man affirmed, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>yesterday he happened to brake that Knife, and
that he cast away the upper part, this afflicted
person being then [102] present, the young Man
was dismist, and she was bidden by the Court not
to tell lyes;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and was improved (after as she had
been before) to give Evidence against the Prisoners.</p>

<p>At Execution, Mr. <i>Noyes</i> urged <i>Sarah Good</i> to
Confess, and told her she was a Witch, and she
knew she was a Witch, to which she replied, you
are a lyer; I am no more a Witch than you are a
Wizard, and if you take away my Life, God will
give you Blood to drink.</p>

<p>At the Tryal of <i>Rebecca Nurse</i>, this was remarkable
that the Jury brought in their Verdict
not Guilty, immediately all the accusers in the
Court, and, suddenly after all the afflicted out of
Court, made an hideous out-cry, to the amazement,
not only of the Spectators, but the Court
also seemed strangely surprized: one of the Judges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>exprest himself not satisfied, another of them as
he was going off the Bench, said they would have
her Indicted anew. The chief Judge said he
would not Impose upon the Jury; but intimated,
as if they had not well considered one Expression
of the Prisoners when she was upon Tryal, <i>viz.</i>
That when one <i>Hobbs</i>, who had confessed herself
to be a Witch, was brought into the Court to
witness against her, the Prisoner turning her head
to her, said, [<i>What, do you bring her? she is one of
us</i>] or to that effect, this together with the Clamours
of the Accusers, induced the Jury to go
out again, after their Verdict, not Guilty. But
not agreeing, they came into the Court, and she
being then at the Bar, her words were repeated to
her, in order to have had her explanation of them,
and she making no Reply to them, they found
the Bill, and brought her in Guilty; these words
being the Inducement to it, as the Foreman has
signified in writing, as follows.</p>

<p><i>July</i> 4, 1692. I Thomas Fisk,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> <i>the Subscriber
hereof, being one of them that were of the Jury last
week at</i> Salem-court,<i> upon the Tryal of</i> Rebecca
Nurse, <i>&amp;c. being desired by some of the Relations to
give a Reason why the Jury brought her in Guilty,
after her Verdict not Guilty; I do hereby give my
Reasons to be as follows, viz.</i></p>

<p><i>When the Verdict not Guilty was, the honored Court
was pleased to object against it, saying to them, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>they think they let slip the words, which the Prisoner
at the Bar spake against herself, which were spoken
in reply to Goodwife</i> Hobbs <i>and her Daughter, who
had been faulty in setting their hands to the Devils
Book, as they have confessed formerly; the words were</i>
[What do these persons give in Evidence against
me now, they used to come among us.] <i>After
the honored Court had manifested their dissatisfaction of
the Verdict, several of the Jury declared themselves
desirous to go out again, and thereupon the Honoured
Court gave leave; but when we came to consider of
the Case, I could not tell how to take her words, as
an Evidence against her, till she had a further opportunity
to put her Sense upon them, if she would
take it; and then going into Court, I mentioned the
words aforesaid, which by one of the</i> [103] <i>Court
were affirmed to have been spoken by her, she being
then at the Bar, but made no reply, nor interpretation
of them; whereupon these words were to me a principal
Evidence against her.</i></p>

<p class="right">
Thomas Fisk.
</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang p2">When goodwife <i>Nurse</i> was informed what use was
made of these words, she put in this following
Declaration into the Court.</p></blockquote>

<p class="dropcap">THESE <i>presents do humbly shew to the honoured
Court and Jury, that I being informed, that
the Jury brought me in Guilty, upon my saying that
Goodwife</i> Hobbs <i>and her Daughter were of our Company;
but I intended no otherways, than as they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Prisoners with us, and therefore did then, and yet do
judge them not legal Evidence against their fellow
Prisoners. And I being something hard of hearing,
and full of grief, none informing me how the Court
took up my words, and therefore had no opportunity to
declare what I intended, when I said they were of our
Company.</i></p>

<p class="right">
Rebecka Nurse.
</p>

<p class="p2">After her Condemnation she was by one of the
Ministers of <i>Salem</i> excommunicated; yet the
Governour saw cause to grant a Reprieve, which
when known (and some say immediately upon
granting) the Accusers renewed their dismal outcries
against her, insomuch that the Governour
was by some <i>Salem</i> Gentleman prevailed with to
recall the Reprieve, and she was Executed with
the rest.</p>

<p>The Testimonials of her Christian behaviour,
both in the course of her Life, and at her Death,
and her extraordinary care in educating her
Children, and setting them good Examples, <i>&amp;c.</i>
under the hands of so many, are so numerous,
that for brevity they are here omitted.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>It was at the Tryal of these that one of the
Accusers cried out publickly of Mr. <i>Willard</i>
Minister in <i>Boston</i>, as afflicting of her, she was
sent out of the Court, and it was told about she
was mistaken in the person.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
<i>August</i> 5. The Court again sitting, six more
were tried on the same Account, viz. Mr. <i>George
Burroughs</i>, sometime minister of <i>Wells</i>, <i>John
Procter</i>, and <i>Elizabeth Procter</i> his Wife, with
<i>John Willard</i> of <i>Salem</i>-Village, <i>George Jacobs</i>
Senior, of <i>Salem</i>, and <i>Martha Carryer</i> of <i>Andover</i>;
these were all brought in Guilty and
Condemned; and were all Executed <i>August</i>
19, except <i>Procter's</i> Wife, who pleaded Pregnancy.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Mr. <i>Burroughs</i> was carried in a Cart with the
others, through the streets of <i>Salem</i> to Execution;
when he was upon the Ladder, he made a
Speech for the clearing of his Innocency, with
such Solemn and Serious Expressions, as were to
the Admiration of all present; his Prayer (which
he concluded by repeating the Lord's Prayer,)
was so well worded, and uttered with such composedness,
and such (at least seeming) fervency of
[104] Spirit, as was very affecting, and drew Tears
from many (so that it seemed to some, that the
Spectators would hinder the Execution) the accusers
said the black Man stood and dictated to
him; as soon as he was turned off, Mr. <i>Cotton
Mather</i>, being mounted upon a Horse, addressed
himself to the People, partly to declare, that he
was no ordained Minister, and partly to possess
the People of his guilt; saying That the Devil
has often been transformed into an Angel of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
Light;<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and this did somewhat appease the People,
and the Executions went on; when he was
cut down, he was dragged by the Halter to a
Hole, or Grave, between the Rocks, about two
foot deep, his Shirt and Breeches being pulled off,
and an old pair of Trousers of one Executed, put
on his lower parts, he was so put in, together
with <i>Willard</i> and <i>Carryer</i>, one of his Hands and
his Chin, and a Foot of one of them being left
uncovered.</p>

<p><i>John Willard</i>, had been imployed to fetch in
several that were accused; but taking dissatisfaction
from his being sent, to fetch up some that he
had better thoughts of, he declined the Service,
and presently after he himself was accused of the
same Crime, and that with such vehemency, that
they sent after him to apprehend him; he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
made his Escape as far as Nashawag,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> about 40
Miles from <i>Salem</i>; yet 'tis said those Accusers did
then presently tell the exact time, saying, now
<i>Willard</i> is taken.</p>

<p><i>John Procter</i> and his Wife being in Prison,
the Sheriff came to his House and seized all the
Goods, Provisions, and Cattle that he could come
at, and sold some of the Cattle at half price, and
killed others, and put them up for the <i>West-Indies</i>;
threw out the Beer out of a Barrel, and
carried away the Barrel; emptied a Pot of
Broath, and took away the Pot, and left nothing
in the House for the support of the Children:
No part of the said Goods are known to be returned.
<i>Procter</i> earnestly requested Mr. <i>Noyes</i>
to pray with and for him, but it was wholly denied,
because he would not own himself to be a
Witch.</p>

<p>During his Imprisonment he sent the following
Letter, in behalf of himself and others.</p>

themselves to be Witches, and do accuse some of us, of

<p><i>September</i> 17. Nine more received Sentance of
Death, viz. <i>Margaret Scot</i> of <i>Rowley</i>, Goodwife
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span><i>Redd</i> of <i>Marblehead, Samuel Wardwell,</i> and <i>Mary

who pleaded Pregnancy, <i>Rebecca Eames</i> of
<i>Boxford, Mary Lacy,</i> and <i>Ann Foster</i> of <i>Andover,</i>
and <i>Abigail Hobbs</i> of <i>Topsfield.</i> Of these Eight
were Executed, <i>September</i> 22, viz. <i>Martha Cory,

Parker</i>.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p><i>Giles Cory</i> pleaded not Guilty to his Indictment,
but would not put himself upon Tryal by the
Jury (they having cleared none upon Tryal) and
knowing there would be the same Witnesses
against him, rather chose to undergo what Death
they would put him to. In pressing his Tongue
being prest out of his Mouth, the Sheriff with
his Cane forced it in again, when he was dying.
He was the first in <i>New-England</i> that was ever
prest to Death.</p>

<p>The Cart going to the Hill with these Eight
to Execution, was for some time at a sett; the
afflicted and others said, that the Devil hindered
it,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

Innocency, concluded her Life with an Eminent
Prayer upon the Ladder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>

<i>Wardwell</i> having formerly confessed himself
Guilty, and after denied it, was soon brought
upon his Tryal; his former Confession and Spectre
Testimony was all that appeared against him.
At Execution while he was speaking to the People,
protesting his Innocency, the Executioner
being at the same time smoaking Tobacco, the
smoak coming in his Face, interrupted his Discourse,
those Accusers said, the Devil hindered
him with smoak.</p>

<p>[107] <i>Mary Easty</i>, Sister also to <i>Rebecca Nurse</i>,
when she took her last farewell of her Husband,
Children and Friends, was, as is reported by them
present, as Serious, Religious, Distinct, and Affectionate
as could well be exprest, drawing Tears
from the Eyes of almost all present. It seems besides
the Testimony of the Accusers and Confessors,
another proof, as it was counted, appeared against
her, it having been usual to search the Accused
for Tets; upon some parts of her Body, not here
to be named, was found an Excrescence, which
they called a Tet. Before her Death she put
up the following Petition:</p>

<p><i>To the Honorable Judge and Bench now sitting
in Judicature in</i> Salem <i>and the Reverend Ministers,
humbly sheweth, That whereas your humble poor
Petitioner being Condemned to die, doth humbly beg
of you, to take it into your Judicious and Pious
Consideration, that your poor and humble Petitioner
knowing my own Innocency (blessed be the Lord for
it) and seeing plainly the Wiles and Subtilty of my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Accusers, by myself, cannot but judge charitably
of others, that are going the same way with
myself, if the Lord step not mightily in. I was
confined a whole Month on the same account that
I am now condemned for, an then cleared by
the Afflicted persons, as some of your Honour
know, and in two days time I was cried out upon by
them, and have been confined and now am condemned
to die. The Lord above knows my Innocency then,
and likewise doth now, as at the great day will be
known to Men and Angels. I Petition to your Honours
not for my own Life, for I know I must die,
and my appointed time is set; but the Lord he knows
it is, if it be possible, that no more Innocent Blood be
shed, which undoubtedly cannot be avoided in the way
and course you go in. I question not, but your Honours
do the utmost of your powers, in the discovery
and detection of Witchcraft and Witches, and would
not be guilty of Innocent Blood for the World; but
by my own Innocency I know you are in the wrong
way, the Lord in his infinite Mercy direct you in
this great work, if it be his blessed will, that Innocent
Blood be not shed; I would humbly beg of you,
that your Honours would be pleased to Examine
some of those confessing Witches, I being confident
there are several of them have belyed themselves
and others, as will appear, if not in this World, I
am sure in the World to come, whither I am going;
and I question not, but yourselves will see an alteration
in these things: They say, myself and others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
have made a league with the Devil, we cannot confess,
I know and the Lord he knows (as will shortly
appear) they belye me, and so I question not but they
do others; the Lord alone, who is the searcher of all
hearts, knows that as I shall answer it at the Tribunal
Seat, that I know not the least thing of Witchcraft,
therefore I cannot, I durst not belye my own
Soul. I beg your Honours not to deny this my humble
Petition, from a poor dying Innocent person, and
I question not but the Lord will give a blessing to
your Endeavours.</i></p>

could Afflict in a good Mans shape; it seems
nothing else could convince him: yet when it
came so near to himself, he was soon convinc'd

George Corwin, <i>Sheriff.</i>
</p>

<p class="p2">But before this the said <i>Bishops</i> Eldest Son,
having Married into that Family of the <i>Putmans</i>,
who were chief Prosecutors in this business; he
holding a Cow to be branded lest it should be
seiz'd, and having a Push or Boyl upon his Thigh,
with his straining it broke; this is that that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
pretended to be burnt with the said Brand; and is
one of the bones thrown to the Dogmatical to

the other, of a Corner of a Sheet, pretended to
be taken from a Spectre, it is known that it was
provided the day before, by that Afflicted person,
and the third bone of a Spindle is almost as easily
provided, as the piece of the Knife; so that <i>Apollo</i>
needs not herein be consulted, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Mr. <i>Philip English</i>,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and his Wife having made
their Escape out of Prison, Mr. <i>Corwin</i> the Sheriff
seiz'd his Estate, to the value of about Fifteen
Hundred Pound, which was wholly lost to him,
except about Three Hundred Pound value, (which
was afterward restored.)</p>

<p>[109] After Goodwife <i>Hoar</i> was Condemned,
her Estate was seiz'd, and was also bought again
for Eight Pound.</p>

<p><i>George Jacobs</i>, Son to old <i>Jacobs</i> being accused,
he fled, then the Officers came to his
House, his Wife was a Woman Crazy in her
Senses and had been so several Years. She it
seems had been also accused, there were in the
House with her only four small Children, and
one of them suck'd her Eldest Daughter, being
in Prison; the Officer perswaded her out of the
House, to go along with him, telling her she
should speedily return, the Children ran a great
way after her crying.</p>

<p>When she came where the Afflicted were, being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>asked, they said they did not know her, at length
one said, don't you know <i>Jacobs</i> the old Witch,
and then they cry'd out of her, and fell down in
their Fits; she was sent to Prison, and lay there
Ten Months, the Neighbours of pity took care
of the Children to preserve them from perishing.</p>

<p>About this time a New Scene was begun, one
<i>Joseph Ballard</i><a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> of <i>Andover</i>, whose Wife was ill
(and after died of a Fever) sent to <i>Salem</i> for some
of those Accusers, to tell him who afflicted his
Wife; others did the like: Horse and Man were
sent from several places to fetch those Accusers
who had the Spectral sight, that they might
thereby tell who afflicted those that were any
ways ill.</p>

<p>When these came into any place where such
were, usually they fell into a Fit; after which
being asked who it was that afflicted the person,
they would, for the most part, name one whom
they said sat on the head, and another that sat on
the lower parts of the afflicted. Soon after <i>Ballard's</i>
sending (as above) more than Fifty of the
People of <i>Andover</i> were complained of, for afflicting
their Neighbours. Here it was that many
accused themselves, of Riding upon Poles through
the Air; many Parents believing their Children
to be Witches, and many Husbands their Wives,
<i>&amp;c.</i> When these Accusers came to the House of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>any upon such account, it was ordinary for other
young People to be taken in Fits, and to have
the same Spectral sight.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Mr. <i>Dudley Bradstreet</i>,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> a Justice of Peace in
<i>Andover</i>, having granted out Warrants against,
and Committed Thirty or Forty to Prisons, for
the supposed Witchcrafts, at length saw cause to
forbear granting out any more Warrants. Soon
after which he and his Wife were cried out of,
himself was (by them) said to have killed Nine
persons by Witchcraft, and found it his safest
course to make his Escape.</p>

<p>A Dog being afflicted at <i>Salem</i>-Village, those
that had the Spectral sight being sent for, they
accused Mr. <i>John Bradstreet</i> (Brother to the Justice)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
that he afflicted the said Dog, and now rid
upon him: He made his Escape into <i>Pescattequa</i>-Government,
and the Dog was put to death, and
was all of the Afflicted that suffered death.</p>

<p>[110] At <i>Andover</i>, the Afflicted complained of
a Dog, as afflicting of them, and would fall into
their Fits at the Dogs looking upon them; the
Dog was put to death.</p>

<p>A worthy Gentleman of <i>Boston</i>,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> being about
this time accused by those at <i>Andover</i>, he sent by
some particular Friends a Writ to Arrest those
Accusers in a Thousand Pound Action for Defamation,
with instructions to them, to inform
themselves of the certainty of the proof, in doing
which their business was perceived, and from
thence forward the Accusations at <i>Andover</i> generally
ceased.</p>

<p>In <i>October</i> some of these Accusers were sent
for to <i>Gloucester</i>, and occasioned four Women to
be sent to Prison, but <i>Salem</i> Prison being so full
it could receive no more; two were sent to <i>Ipswich</i>
Prison.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> In <i>November</i> they were sent for
again by Lieutenant <i>Stephens</i>, who was told that
a Sister of his was bewitched; in their way passing
over <i>Ipswich</i>-bridge, they met with an old
Woman, and instantly fell into their Fits: But by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>this time the validity of such Accusations being
much questioned, they found not that Encouragement
they had done elsewhere, and soon withdrew.</p>

<p>These Accusers swore that they saw three persons
sitting upon Lieutenant <i>Stephens's</i> Sister till
she died; yet Bond was accepted for those Three.</p>

<p>And now Nineteen persons having been hang'd,
and one prest to death, and Eight more condemned,
in all Twenty and eight, of which above
a third part were Members of some of the
Churches in <i>N. England</i>, and more than half of
them of a good Conversation in general, and not
one clear'd. About Fifty having confest themselves
to be Witches, of which not one Executed;
above an Hundred and Fifty in Prison, and above
Two Hundred more accused. The Special Commission
of <i>Oyer</i> and <i>Terminer</i> comes to a period,
which has no other foundation than the Governours
Commission, and had proceeded in the manner
of swearing Witnesses, <i>viz.</i> By holding up
the hand, (and by receiving Evidences in writing)
according to the Ancient Usuge of this Countrey;
as also having their Indictments in <i>English</i>. In
the Tryals, when any were Indicted for Afflicting,
Pining, and wasting the Bodies of particular
persons by Witchcraft; it was usual to hear Evidence
of matter foreign, and of perhaps Twenty
or Thirty years standing, about over-setting Carts,
the death of Cattle, unkindness to Relations, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
unexpected Accidents befalling after some quarrel.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
Whether this was admitted by the Law of
<i>England</i>, or by what other Law, wants to be
determined; the Executions seemed mixt, in
pressing to death for not pleading, which most
agrees with the Laws of <i>England</i>, and Sentencing
Women to be hanged for Witchcraft, according
to the former practice of this Country, and not
by burning, as is said to have been the Law of
<i>England</i>. And though the confessing Witches
were many; yet not one of them that confessed
their own guilt, and abode by their Confession
were put to Death.</p>

<p>[111] Here followeth what account some of
those miserable Creatures give of their Confession
under their own hands.</p>

<p><i>We whose Names are under written, Inhabitants
of</i> Andover, <i>when as that horrible and tremendous
Judgment beginning at</i> Salem-<i>Village, in the Year</i>
1692, <i>(by some) call'd Witchcraft, first breaking
forth at Mr.</i> Parris's <i>House, several Young persons
being seemingly afflicted, did accuse several persons
for afflicting them, and many there believing it so to
be; we being informed that if a person were sick,
that the afflicted persons could tell, what or who was
the cause of that sickness.</i> Joseph Ballard <i>of</i> Andover
<i>(his Wife being sick at the same time) he
either from himself, or by the advice of others,
fetch'd two of the persons call'd the afflicted persons,
from</i> Salem-<i>Village to</i> Andover: <i>Which was the beginning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
of that dreadful Calamity that befel us in</i>
Andover. <i>And the Authority in</i> Andover, <i>believing
the said Accusations to be true, sent for the
said persons to come together to the Meeting-house in</i>
Andover <i>(the afflicted persons being there.) After
Mr.</i> Bernard<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> <i>had been at Prayer, we were blindfolded,
and our hands were laid upon the afflicted
persons, they being in their Fits, and falling into
their Fits at our coming into their presence (as they
said) and some led us and laid our hands upon them,
and then they said they were well, and that we were
guilty of afflicting of them; whereupon we were all
seized as Prisoners, by a Warrant from the Justice
of the Peace, and forthwith carried to</i> Salem. <i>And
by reason of that suddain surprizal, we knowing
ourselves altogether Innocent of that Crime, we were
all exceedingly astonished and amazed, and consternated
and affrighted even out of our Reason; and our
nearest and dearest Relations, seeing us in that dreadful
condition, and knowing our great danger, apprehending
that there was no other way to save our
lives, as the case was then circumstantiated but by
our confessing ourselves to be such and such persons,
as the afflicted represented us to be, they out of tender
love and pitty perswaded us to confess what we did
confess. And indeed that Confession, that it is said
we made, was no other than what was suggested to
us by some Gentlemen; they telling us, that we were
Witches, and they knew it, and we knew it, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>they knew that we knew it, which made us think
that it was so; and our understanding, our reason,
and our faculties almost gone; we were not capable
of judging our condition; as also the hard measures
they used with us, rendred us uncapable of making
our Defence; but said any thing and every thing
which they desired, and most of what we said, was
but in effect a consenting to what they said. Sometime
after when we were better composed, they telling
of us what we had confessed, we did profess that we
were Innocent, and Ignorant of such things. And
we hearing that</i> Samuel Wardwell <i>had renounced
his Confession, and quickly after Condemned and
Executed, some of us were told that we were going
after</i> Wardwell.</p>

Barker, Sarah Wilson, Hannah Tiler.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">[112] It may here be further added concerning
those that did Confess, that besides that powerful
Argument, of Life (and freedom from hardships,
and Irons not only promised, but also performed
to all that owned their guilt.) There are numerous
Instances, too many to be here inserted, of
the tedious Examinations before private persons,
many hours together; they all that time urging
them to Confess (and taking turns to perswade
them) till the accused were wearied out by being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>forced to stand so long, or for want of Sleep, <i>&amp;c.</i>
and so brought to give an Assent to what they
said; they then asking them, Were you at such a
Witch-meeting, or have you signed the Devils
Book, <i>&amp;c.</i> upon their replying, yes, the whole
was drawn into form as their Confession.</p>

<p>But that which did mightily further such Confessions,
was their nearest and dearest Relations
urging them to it. These seeing no other way of
escape for them, thought it the best advice that
could be given; hence it was that the Husbands
of some, by counsel often urging, and utmost earnestness,
and Children upon their Knees intreating,
have at length prevailed with them, to say
they were guilty.</p>

<p class="dropcap p2">AS to the manner of Tryals, and the Evidence

that when these Calamities first began,
which was in my own Family,
the Affliction was several Weeks
before such hellish Operations as
Witchcraft was suspected; Nay, it
never broke forth to any considerable
Light, until diabolical Means was
used, by the making of a Cake by
my Indian Man [John], who had
his Directions from this our Sister
Mary Sibly. Since which Apparitions
have been plenty, and exceeding
much Mischief hath followed.
But by this Means (it
seems) the Devil hath been raised
amongst us, and his Rage is vehement
and terrible; and when he
shall be silenced, the Lord only
knows."&mdash;<i>Hanson's Hist. Danvers</i>,

They had several sore Fits, in the
Time of Publick Worship, which
did something interrupt me in my

Psalm was Sung, <i>Abigail Williams</i>
said to me, <i>Now stand up</i>, and

of Rebecca Nurse is dated
23 March, 169½. The Day following,
the Marshal, George Herrick,
made his Return, that he had
brought her to the house of <i>Nath.
Ingersal</i>, where she was in Custody.
The Witnesses were Ann Puttnam,
Jr., Abigail Williams, Mary Walcott,
and Elizabeth Hubbard. Mary
Walcott's Age was about 17; Elizabeth
Hubbard's also about 17. Nothing
could be too abominable for
these Miscreants to make up and
swear to. Mary Walcott said,
among other things, that besides
being "most greviously afflicted by"
being bitten, pinched, and almost
choked by the Prisoner, because she
would not write in her Book, Goody
N. said she would kill her if she
did not; and on the 3rd of May,
in the Evening the Apparition of
the Prisoner told her "she had an
Hand in the Deaths of Benjamin
Holton, John Harrod, Rebekah
Sheppard and seuerall others."
</p>
<p>
Abigail Williams's Testimony is
much the same. She heard the Accused
confess (by her Apparition)
the committing of several Murders,
together with her Sister Cloyse; as
upon old Goodm: Hanvood, Benj.
Porter and Rebek: Shepard....
Sarah Vibber, Mr. Sam: Parris, N.
Ingersoll and T. Putnam also testified
against the poor aged Woman.
Putnam's Age was about 40; Parris's,
as before mentioned, about
39. John Putnam, Sen. (another
Wit.) aged about 63. Edwd. Putnam,
another, aged about 30. Another,
Sarah Holton, relict of Benj.
Holton. Another, Ann Putnam,
Wife of Thomas, swore to the
choking by the Accused, and to her
declaring she would kill her, and
said she had killed Benj. Holton,
John Fuller and Rebekah Shepard;
also that she and her Sister Cloyse
and Ed: Bishop had killed young
John Putnam's Child.... "Immediately
there did appear to me
six Children in Winding-sheets,
which called me Aunt.... Told
me they were my Sister Baker's
Children of Boston; and that Gooddy
Nurs, and Mistris Cary of
Charlestown, and an old deaf Woman
at Boston had murthered them....
Also there appeared to me
my own Sister Bayley and three of
her Children in Winding-sheets,

The Testimony and Indictment
against Philip English may be
seen in the <i>Hist. and Antiq's Boston</i>,
497, printed from the Originals in
the Author's Possession. With the
same are the two Indictments (in
the Hand-writing of Edward Rawson),
charging him with bewitching
Elizabeth Booth, of Salem, Single-woman,
and Mary Wallcott. These
Indictments are both dated May
31st, 1692. The Monsters who
carried on the Charges, were much
like a Pack of hungry Wolves.
One would set up the Howl of
Witch, and immediately others
would follow. So in the Case of
Philip English, a large number of
Persons joined those Girls in their
"Crying out on" him. This encouraged
them to keep up their Deceptions.
Mrs. English was accused
before her Husband. One
Mary Warren, Servant to Mr.
Procter, outwent all others, except
perhaps Elizabeth Booth, in the
Invention of Stories. Rebutting
Testimony was brought against her,
but it had no Effect with the Court.
Edward Bishop, aged 44; Sarah,
41, and Mary Estey, 56; all said
that they heard Mary Warren say,
when in Jail together in Salem, that
the Magistrates might as well examine
Keysar's Daughter that had
been distracted many Years, and
believe what she said, as well as
what any of the Afflicted said. Mary
English, aged 39, said, being at Salem
about a Month before, she
heard Mary Warren speak the same
Words.</p></div>

as far as it was possible to
be done; Every thing in the World
was done, but only declaring that

the <i>Charter</i> no <i>Damage</i>; which if
some were wiser then to say, who

this <i>Reassumption</i>! They that were
acquainted with me, I am sure, did
not think so; and they that sent
their <i>Tory Pamphlets</i> about the

assisting the <i>Reassumed Government</i>,
I am sure did not think so. Let

Gov. Phips, though he may have
ordered a further Supply, as Prisoners
greatly increased about that
Time. Mr. Felt, the Annalist of
Salem, furnished Mr. J. W. Hanson
with a Copy of an Account of
the Prison-keeper (John Arnold),
of Boston, for various Items used
in the Prison. Said Account begins
about the 7th of March, 1691-2.

Cary, who came to Charlestown in

made against Mrs. Cary by Mr.

The Complaint was that she had

of an Innocent Person; and as being
an <i>Inciter</i> of the Judges, to the
Conviction of <i>Witchcrafts</i> upon
that Opinion. It is very certain
that his Conscience must needs tell
him, this is a most <i>Lying Accusation</i>.
For in my Book of <i>Memorable

the Troubles at <i>Salem</i>, and even
<i>before I was so fully acquainted with
the Wiles of Satan</i>, (for my saying
of which, on a certain Occasion,

Paragraph to caution against <i>accounting

one of a singularly revolting Character.
Her own Daughter, named
Dorothy, was one of the Witnesses
against her. Said her Mother "had
three Birds, one black, one yellow,
and that these Birds hurt the Children
and afflicted Persons."&mdash;<i>Records

gave her a very bad Character,
but said he knew nothing of her
being a Witch. The Story of the
broken Knife, I do not remember
seeing in the <i>Records</i>. It was probably
suppressed. Samuel Abbey
and Mary his Wife, aged about 45
and 38, respectively, testified that
William Good and his Wife Sarah,
being destitute of a House to dwell
in, they took them in out of Charity;
but about two years and a half
before, were obliged to turn them
out "for quietness sake, the said
Sarah was of so turbulant a Sperritt,
spitefull and mallitiously bent."
Whereupon the said Abbey in about
two years lost 17 head of Cattle,
besides Sheep and "Hoggs."&mdash;<i>Records</i>,

<p>[113] BUT I shall no longer detain my Reader
from his expected entertainment, in a brief account
of the Tryals, which have passed upon
some of the Malefactors, lately Executed at <i>Salem</i>,
for the Witchcrafts whereof they stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
convicted. For my own part I was not present
at any of them; nor ever had I any personal
prejudice at the persons thus brought upon
the Stage; much less, at the surviving Relations
of those persons, with and for whom, I would be
as hearty a mourner, as any Man living in the
World: <i>The Lord comfort them!</i> But having received
a command so to do, I can do no other
than shortly relate the chief Matters of Fact,
which occurr'd in the Tryals of some that were
Executed; in an Abridgment collected out of the
Court-Papers, on this occasion put into my hands.
You are to take the truth, just as it was; and the
truth will hurt no good Man. There might
have been more of these, if my Book would not
thereby have been swelled too big; and if some
other Worthy hands did not perhaps intend something
further in these Collections; for which
cause I have only singled out four or five, which
may serve to Illustrate the way of dealing, wherein
Witchcrafts use to be concerned; and I report
matters not as an Advocate, but as an Historian.</p>

<p>They were some of the Gracious words inserted
in the Advice, which many of the Neighbouring
Ministers did this Summer humbly lay
before our Honourable Judges, We cannot but
with all thankfulness, acknowledge the success,
which the merciful God has given unto the
Sedulous and Assiduous Endeavours of our Honorable
Rulers, to detect the Abominable Witchcrafts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
which have been committed in the Country;
Humbly praying that the discovery of those
Mysterious, and Mischievous wickednesses, may
be perfected. If in the midst of the many Dissatisfactions
among us, the publication of these Tryals,
may promote such a Pious thankfulness unto
God, for Justice being so far executed among us,
I shall rejoice that God is glorified; and pray that
no wrong steps of ours may ever sully any of his
glorious works.</p>

<i>The Tryal of</i> G. B. <i>as Printed in</i> Wonders of the
Invisible World, <i>from</i> P. 94 <i>to</i> 104.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">GLAD should I have been, if I had never
known the name of this Man; or never
had this occasion to mention so much as the first
Letters of his name. But the Government requiring
some Account of his trial, to be inserted
in this Book, it becomes me with all obedience
to submit unto the Order.</p>

<p>1. This <i>G. B.</i> was Indicted for Witchcrafts;
and in the Prosecution of the Charge against
him, he was Accused by five or six of the Bewitched,
as the Author of their Miseries; he was
accused by Eight of the confessing Witches, as
being an head Actor at some of their Hellish
Randezvouzes, and who had the promise of being
a King in Satan's Kingdom, now going to be
erected; he was accused by Nine persons, for
extraordinary lifting, and such feats of strength
as could not be done without a Diabolical Assistance.
And for other such things he was accused,
until about Thirty Testimonies<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> were brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>in against him; nor were these judg'd the half
of what might have been consider'd for his Conviction:
however they were enough to fix the
Character of a Witch upon him, according to the
Rules of Reasoning, by the judicious <i>Gaule</i>, in
that case directed.</p>

<p>[115] The Court being sensible, that the Testimonies
of the Parties Bewitched, use to have a
Room among the Suspicions, or Presumptions,
brought in against one Indicted for Witchcraft,
there were now heard the Testimonies of several
Persons who were most notoriously bewitched,
and every day tortured by Invisible hands, and
these now all charged the Spectres of <i>G. B.</i> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
have a share in their Torments. At the Examination
of this <i>G. B.</i> the bewitched People were
grievously harrassed with preternatural Mischiefs,
which could not possibly be dissembled; and they
still ascribed it unto the Endeavours of <i>G. B.</i> to
kill them. And now upon his Trial, one of the
bewitched persons testified, That in her <i>Agonies</i>
a little Black-haired Man came to her, saying
his name was <i>B.</i> and bidding her set her hand
unto a Book, which he shewed unto her; and
bragging that he was a Conjuror above the ordinary
Rank of Witches; that he often persecuted
her, with the offer of that Book, saying, she
should be well, and need fear nobody, if she
would but sign it: but he inflicted cruel pains
and hurts upon her, because of her denying so to
do.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The Testimonies of the other Sufferers,
concurred with these; and it was remarkable,
that whereas Biting, was one of the ways, which
the Witches used, for the vexing of the Sufferers,
when they cry'd out of <i>G. B.</i> biting them, the
print of his Teeth would be seen on the Flesh
of the Complainers; and just such a set of Teeth
as <i>G. B</i>'s. would then appear upon them, which
could be distinguished from those of some other
Mens.</p>

<p>Others of them testified, that in their Torments
<i>G. B.</i> tempted them to go unto a
Sacrament, unto which they perceived him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>with a sound of Trumpet summoning of other
Witches; who quickly after the sound would
come from all quarters unto the Randezvous.
One of them falling into a kind of Trance, afterwards
affirmed, that <i>G. B.</i> had carried her into
a very high Mountain, where he shewed her
mighty and glorious Kingdoms, and said he
would give them all to her, if she would write
in his Book; but she told him, They were none
of his to give; and refused the Motions; enduring
of much misery for that refusal.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>It cost the Court a wonderful deal of trouble
to hear the Testimonies of the Sufferers; for
when they were going to give in their Depositions,
they would for a long while be taken with
Fits, that made them uncapable of saying any
thing. The chief Judge asked the Prisoner, who
he thought hindered these Witnesses from giving
their Testimonies? and he answered, He supposed
it was the Devil. That Honourable person then
replied, How comes the Devil so loth to have
any Testimony borne against you? Which cast
him into very great confusion.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p>3. It hath been a frequent thing for the bewitched
People, to be entertained with Apparitions
of Ghosts of murdered People, at the same
time that the Spectres of the Witches trouble
them. These Ghosts do always [116] affright
the beholders, more than all the other Spectral
Representations; and when they exhibit themselves,
they cry out of being murdered by the
Witchcrafts or other Violences of the persons
who are then in Spectre present. It is further
considerable, that once or twice these Apparitions
have been seen by others, at the very same time
they have shown themselves to the bewitched;
and seldom have there been these Apparitions,
but when something unusual and suspected hath
attended the death of the Party thus appearing.
Some that have been accused by these Apparitions,
accosting of the bewitched People, who
had never heard a word of any such persons ever
being in the World, have upon a fair Examination,
freely and fully confessed the Murders of
those very persons, although these also did not
know how the Apparitions had complained of
them. Accordingly several of the bewitched
had given in their Testimony, that they had been
troubled with the Apparitions of two Women,
who said they were <i>G. B</i>'s two Wives; and that
he had been the death of them; and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Magistrates must be told of it, before whom, if
<i>B.</i> upon his Tryal denied it, they did not know
but that they should appear again in the Court.
Now <i>G. B.</i> had been infamous, for the barbarous
usage of his two successive Wives, all the Countrey
over. Moreover, it was testified, the Spectre
of <i>G. B.</i> threatning of the Sufferers told them
he had killed (besides others) Mrs. <i>Lawson</i> and
her Daughter <i>Ann</i>. And it was noted, that these
were the Vertuous Wife and Daughter of one, at
whom this <i>G. B.</i> might have a prejudice, for
being serviceable at <i>Salem</i>-Village, from whence
himself had in ill terms removed some Years
before, and that when they dy'd, which was long
since, there were some odd circumstances about
them, which made some of the Attendants there
suspect something of Witchcraft, though none
imagined from what quarter it should come.</p>

<p>Well <i>G. B.</i> being now upon his Tryal, one of
the bewitched persons was cast into horror at the
Ghosts of <i>B</i>'s. two deceased Wives, then appearing
before him, and crying for vengeance against
him. Hereupon several of the bewitched persons
were successively called in, who all, not
knowing what the former had seen and said, concurred
in their horror of the Apparition, which
they affirmed, that he had before him. But he,
though much appalled, utterly denied that he
discerned any thing of it, nor was it any part of
his Conviction.</p>

<p>4. Judicious writers have assigned it a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
place, in the Conviction of Witches, when persons
are Impeached by other notorious Witches
to be as ill as themselves, especially if the persons
have been much noted for neglecting the Worship
of God. Now as there might have been Testimonies
enough of <i>G. B</i>'s. Antipathy to Prayer,
and the other Ordinances of God, though by his
Profession singularly obliged thereunto; so there
now came in against the Prisoner, the Testimonies
of several persons, who [117] confessed their
own having been horrible Witches, and ever since
their Confessions, had been themselves terribly tortured
by the Devils and other Witches, even like
the other Sufferers; and therein undergone the
pains of many deaths for their Confessions.</p>

<p>These now testified, that <i>G. B.</i> had been at
Witch-meetings with them; and that he was the
person who had seduced and compelled them
into the Snares of Witchcraft: that he promised
them fine Cloaths for doing it; that he brought
Poppets to them, and thorns to stick into those
Poppets, for the afflicting of other People: And
that he exhorted them, with the rest of the Crue
to bewitch all <i>Salem</i>-Village; but be sure to do
it gradually; if they would prevail in what they
did.</p>

<p>When the <i>Lancashire</i> Witches were Condemned,
I do'nt remember that there was any
considerable further Evidence, than that of the
bewitched, and than that of some that had confessed.
We see so much already against <i>G. B.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
But this being indeed not enough, there were
other things to render what had already been
produced credible.</p>

<p>5. A famous Divine, recites this among the
Convictions of a Witch; the Testimony of the
party bewitched, whether pining or dying; together
with the Joint Oaths of sufficient persons,
that have seen certain podigious pranks or feats,
wrought by the party accused. Now God had
been pleased so to leave this <i>G. B.</i> that he had
ensnared himself, by several instances which he
had formerly given of a preternatural strength;
and which were now produced against him. He
was a very puny Man, yet he had often done
things beyond the strength of a Giant.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> A Gun
of about 7 Foot barrel, and so heavy that strong
Men could not steadily hold it out, with both
hands; there were several Testimonies given in
by persons of Credit and Honor, that he made
nothing of taking up such a Gun behind the
Lock with but one hand, and holding it out like
a Pistol, at Arms-end. <i>G. B.</i> in his vindication
was so foolish, as to say, that an <i>Indian</i> was there,
and held it out, at the same time: whereas, none
of the Spectators ever saw any such <i>Indian</i>; but
they supposed the black Man (as the Witches
call the Devil; and they generally say he resembles
an <i>Indian</i>) might give him that Assistance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>There was Evidence likewise brought in, that he
made nothing of taking up whole Barrels fill'd
with Mellasses, or Cyder, in very disadvantageous
Postures, and carrying of them thro' the difficultest
places, out of a Canoa to the Shore.</p>

<p>Yea, there were two Testimonies, that <i>G. B.</i>
with only putting the Fore-finger of his right
hand into the Muzzel of an heavy Gun, a fowling
piece of about six or seven foot Barrel did lift up
the Gun, and hold it out at Arms-end; a Gun
which the Deponents, though strong men, could
not with both hands lift up, and hold out at the
Butt-end, as is usual. Indeed one of these Witnesses,
was over-perswaded by some persons to
[118] be out of way upon <i>G. B</i>'s. Tryal; but he
came afterwards with sorrow for his withdraw,
and gave in his Testimony. Nor were either of
these Witnesses made use of as Evidence in the
Tryal.</p>

<p>6. There came in several Testimonies, relating
to the Domestick affairs of <i>G. B.</i> which had a
very hard Aspect upon him; and not only proved
him a very ill Man, but also confirmed the belief
of the Character, which had been already fastned
on him.</p>

<p>'Twas Testified, that keeping his two successive
Wives in a strange kind of slavery, he would
when he came home from abroad pretend to tell
the talk which any had with them. That he
has brought them to the point of Death, by his
harsh dealings with his Wives, and then made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
People about him to promise that in case Death
should happen they would say nothing of it.
That he used all means to make his Wives Write,
Sign, Seal, and Swear a Covenant never to reveal
any of his Secrets. That his Wives had privately
complained unto the Neighbours about frightly
Apparitions of Evil Spirits, with which their
House was sometimes infested; and that many
such things have been whispered among the
Neighbourhood. There were also some other
Testimonies, relating to the death of People,
whereby the Consciences of an impartial Jury
were convinced, that <i>G. B.</i> had bewitched the
persons mention'd in the Complaints. But I am
forced to omit several such Passages in this as well
as in all the succeeding Tryals, because the Scribes
who took notice of them, have not supplied me.</p>

<p>7. One Mr. <i>Ruck</i>, Brother in Law to this <i>G.
B.</i> testified that <i>G. B.</i> and he himself, and his
Sister, who was <i>G. B</i>'s. Wife, going out for two
or three Miles, to gather Strawberries, <i>Ruck</i> with
his Sister, the Wife of G. B. rode home very
softly, with G. B. on foot, in their company, G.
B. stept aside a little into the Bushes, whereupon
they halted and hollow'd for him. He not answering,
they went away homewards, with a
quickened pace; without any expectation of seeing
him in a considerable while: and yet when
they were got near home, to their astonishment
they found him on foot, with them, having a
Basket of Strawberries. G. B. immediately then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
fell to chiding his Wife, on the account of what
she had been speaking to her Brother of him on
the Road: which when they wondered at, he
said, He knew their thoughts. <i>Ruck</i> being
startled at that, made some reply, intimating that
the Devil himself did not know so far; but G.
B. answered, my god, makes known your thoughts
unto me. The Prisoner now at the Bar had
nothing to answer unto what was thus witnessed
against him, that was worth considering. Only
he said, <i>Ruck</i> and his Wife left a man with him,
when they left him. Which <i>Ruck</i> now affirm'd
to be false; and when the Court asked G. B.
What the mans name was? His countenance was
much altered; nor [119] could he say who it
was. But the Court began to think that he then
stept aside, only that by the Assistance of the
black Man, he might put on his invisibility, and
in that fascinating Mist, gratify his own jealous
humour, to hear what they said of him. Which
trick of rendering themselves invisible, our Witches
do in their Confessions pretend that they sometimes
are masters of; and it is the more credible,
because there is demonstration that they often
render many other things utterly invisible.</p>

<p>8. Faultering, Faulty, Unconstant, and contrary
Answers upon Judicial and deliberate Examination,
are counted some unlucky symptoms
of Guilt in all Crimes, especially in Witchcrafts.
Now there never was a Prisoner more Eminent
for them, than <i>G. B.</i> both at his Examination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
and on his Tryal. His Tergiversations, Contradictions,
and Falsehoods, were very sensible: he
had little to say, but that he had heard some things
that he could not prove, Reflecting upon the Reputation
of some of the Witnesses. Only he
gave in a Paper to the Jury; wherein, altho' he
had many times before granted, not only that
there are Witches, but also that the present Sufferings
of the Countrey are the Effects of Horrible
Witchcrafts, yet he now goes to evince it,
that there neither are nor ever were, Witches,
that having made a compact with the Devil, can
send a Devil to torment other People at a distance.
This Paper was transcribed out of <i>Ady</i>; which
the Court presently knew, as soon as they heard
it. But he said, he had taken none of it out of
any Book; for which his evasion afterwards was,
that a Gentleman gave him the Discourse in a

great Strength, Samuel Webber,
aged about 36, swore, that
"aboute ceauen or eight Yeares
agoe I liued at Casco Bay, and
George Burroughs was then Minester
there, and haueing heard much
of the great Strength of him sd.
Burroughs; he coming to our House
wee ware in discourse aboute the
same and he then told mee yt he
had put his fingers into the Bung of
a Barrell of Malases and lifted it
vp and carryed it round him." Salem,
Augt. 2d, 1692.
</p>
<p>
Ann Putnam swore, that on the
20th of April, 1692, she saw the
<i>Apperishtion</i> of Mr. Burroughs who
tortured her in a terrible Manner;
told her he had had three Wives, and had bewitched two of them to
death; had killed Mistress Lawson
because she was so unwilling to go
from the Village; had killed Mr.
Lawson's Children because he went
to the Eastward with Sir Edmond
[Andros] and preached so to the
Soldiers; had bewitched a great
many Soldiers to death when Sir
<i>Edmon</i> was there, &amp;c. At another
time she swore that the two Wives
of Mr. Burroughs appeared to her
in their Winding-sheets, and told
her how they were murdered. Also
Mrs. Lawson and her Daughter
Ann appeared in the same Manner;
also another Woman who told her
she was Goodman Fuller's first
Wife, and that Mr. Burroughs killed
her, because of a Difference between
her Husband and him.
</p>
<p>
Simon Willard, aged about 42
Years, was at the House of Mr.
Robert Lawrence, of Casco Bay, in
Sept., 1689; saw Mr. Burroughs
show where he took hold of the
Gun of about seven foot Barrel,
which was behind the Lock; and
Mr. B. said he held it out with one
Hand by so taking it, but the Deponent
did not see him do it. Willard
commanded the Fort at Casco.
</p>
<p>
Thomas Greenslett, aged about 40
Years, said he was at Capt. Joshua
Scottow's at Black Point, about the
breaking out of the late Indian
War, where he saw Mr. B. lift a
Gun of six foot Barrel or there-about,
by putting the Forefinger of
his right Hand into the Muzzle;
holding it out at Arm's Length.
Lieut. Richard Hunnewell and John
<i>Greinslett</i> being present. The above
are a few Specimens of the Evidence
on which Mr. Burroughs was
condemned and executed.</p></div>

this was Mercy Lewis. It took
place on the 9th of May, 1692, as
she said: "Mr. Burroughs carried
me up to an exceeding high Mountain
and shewed me all the Kingdoms
of the Earth, and told me he
would give them all to me if I would
writ in his Book, and if I would
not, he would thro me down and
break my Neck: but I tould him

<h3 class="hang"><i>The Tryal</i> of Bridget Bishop, <i>as printed</i>,
<i>in Wonders of Invisible World</i>, June 2,
1692. P. 104 to 114.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap"><span class="dropfix">1.</span>&nbsp; S</span><i>HE was Indicted for bewitching several persons
in the Neighbourhood. The Indictment
being drawn up, according to the form in such cases
usual, and pleading not guilty, there were brought in
several persons, who had long undergone many kinds
of miseries, which were preternaturally inflicted,
and generally ascribed unto an horrible Witchcraft.
There was little occasion to prove the Witchcraft, it
being evident and notorious to all beholders. Now
to fix the Witchcraft on the Prisoner at the Bar,
the first thing used was, the testimony of the bewitched;
whereof several testified, that the shape of the</i> [121]
<i>Prisoner did oftentimes very grievously pinch them,
choak them, bite them, and afflict them; urging them
to write their names in a Book, which the said Spectre
call'd Ours. One of them did further testifie,
that it was the shape of this Prisoner, with another,
which one day took her from her Wheel, and carrying
her to the River side, threatned there to drown her,
if she did not sign the Book mention'd, which yet she
refused. Others of them did also testifie, that the
said shape, did in her threats, brag to them, that she
had been the death of sundry persons, then by her
named. Another testified, the Apparition of Ghosts
unto the Spectre of</i> Bishop, <i>crying out,</i> You murdered us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
<i>About the truth whereof, there was in
the matter of Fact, but too much suspicion.</i><a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>2. <i>It was testified, that at the Examination of the
Prisoner, before the Magistrates, the bewitched were
extreamly tortured. If she did but cast her Eyes on
them, they were presently struck down; and this in
such a manner as there could be no collusion in the
business. But upon the touch of her hand upon them,
when they lay in their swoons, they would immediately
revive; and not upon the touch of any ones
else. Moreover upon some special Actions of her
Body, as the shaking of her head, or the turning of
her Eyes, they presently and painfully fell into the
like postures. And many of the like accidents now
fell out, while she was at the Bar. One at the same
time testifying, that she said,</i> She could not be
troubled to see the Afflicted thus tormented.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>

3. <i>There was Testimony likewise brought in, that
a Man striking once at the place, where a bewitched
person said, the shape of this</i> Bishop <i>stood, the bewitched
cryed out that he had tore her Coat, in the
place then particularly specified; and the Womans
Coat was found to be torn in the very place.</i><a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>

4. <i>One</i> Deliverance Hobbs, <i>who had confessed
her being a Witch, was now tormented by the Spectres
for her Confession. And she now testified that
this</i> Bishop <i>tempted her to sign the Book again, and
to deny what she had confess'd. She affirmed, that
it was the shape of this Prisoner, which whipped
her with Iron Rods, to compel her thereunto. And
she affirmed, that this</i> Bishop <i>was at a General
meeting of the Witches in a field, at</i> Salem-<i>Village;
and there partook of a Diabolical Sacrament, in
Bread and Wine then administered.</i><a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>5. <i>To render it further unquestionable, that the
Prisoner at the Bar was the Person truly charged
in this Witchcraft; there was produced many Evidences
of other Witchcrafts, by her perpetrated.
For instance,</i> John Cook <i>testified, that about five
or six Years ago, one morning about Sun-Rise, he
was in his Chamber, assaulted by the shape of this
Prisoner: which look'd on him, grinn'd at him, and
very much hurt him, with a blow on the side of the
head; and that on the same day about Noon, the
same shape walked in the Room where he was, and
an Apple strangely flew out of his hand, into the lap
of his Mother, six or eight foot from him.</i><a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>

[122] 6. Samuel Gray, <i>testify'd, that about fourteen
Years ago, he wak'd on a Night, and saw the
Room where he lay full of light; and that he then
saw plainly a Woman between the Cradle and the
Bedside, which looked upon him. He rose, and it
vanished; tho he found the Doors all fast: Looking
out at the Entry door, he saw the same Woman
in the same garb again, and said,</i> In God's name,
what do you come for? <i>He went to Bed, and had
the same Woman again assaulting him. The Child
in the Cradle gave a great Screech, and the Woman
disappeared. It was long before the Child could be
quieted; and tho it were a very likely thriving Child,
yet from this time it pined away, and after divers
Months died in a sad condition. He knew not</i> Bishop,
<i>nor her name; but when he saw her after this, he
knew by her countenance, and apparel, and all circumstances,
that it was the Apparition of this</i> Bishop,
<i>which had thus troubled him.</i><a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>7. John Bly <i>and his Wife, testified, that he bought
a Sow of</i> Edward Bishop, <i>the Husband of the Prisoner,
and was to pay the price agreed unto another
person. This Prisoner being angry that she was thus
hindred from fingring the Money, quarrel'd with</i> Bly,
<i>soon after which the Sow was taken with strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>Fitts, jumping, leaping, and knocking her head against
the Fence, she seemed blind and deaf, and would neither
eat nor be sucked. Whereupon a Neighbour said, she
believed the creature was over-looked; and sundry
other circumstances concurred, which made the Deponents
believe that</i> Bishop <i>had bewitched it.</i><a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>8. Richard Coman <i>testified that Eight Years
ago, as he lay awake in his Bed, with a light burning
in the Room, he was annoyed with the Apparition of
this</i> Bishop, <i>and of two more that were strangers to
him; who came and oppressed him so that he could
neither stir himself, nor wake any one else: and that
he was the Night after molested again in the like manner;
the said</i> Bishop <i>taking him by the Throat, and
pulling him almost out of the Bed. His Kinsman
offered for this cause to lodge with him; and that
night, as they were awake discoursing together, this</i>
Coman <i>was once more visited by the Guests which
had formerly been so troublesome, his Kinsman being
at the same time struck speechless, and unable to move
hand or foot. He had laid his Sword by him; which
those unhappy Spectres, did strive much to wrest from
him, only he held too fast for them. He then grew
able to call the People of his house; but altho they
heard him, yet they had not power to speak or stir,
until at last, one of the People crying out, What's the
matter! the Spectres all vanished.</i><a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>

9. <i>Samuel Shattuck</i> testified, that in the Year,
1680. This <i>Bridget Bishop</i>, often came to his
house upon such frivolous and foolish Errands,
that they suspected she came indeed with a purpose
of Mischief. Presently whereupon his Eldest
Child, which was of as promising health and sense,
as any Child of its Age, began to droop exceedingly;
and the [123] oftener that <i>Bishop</i> came to
the house, the worse grew the Child. As the
Child would be standing at the Door, he would be
thrown and bruised against the Stones, by an Invisible
hand, and in like sort knock his face
against the sides of the house, and bruise it after
a miserable manner. Afterwards this <i>Bishop</i>
would bring him things to Dye, whereof he
could not Imagine any use; and when she paid
him a piece of Money, the Purse and Money
were unaccountably conveyed out of a lock'd Box,
and never seen more. The Child was immediately
hereupon taken with terrible Fits, whereof
his friends thought he would have died: Indeed
he did almost nothing but cry and sleep, for
several Months together; and at length his understanding
was utterly taken away. Among other
Symptoms of an Inchantment upon him one was,
that there was a Board in the garden, whereon
he would walk; and all the Invitations in the
world could never fetch him off. About seventeen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
or eighteen Years after, there came a stranger
to <i>Shattocks</i> house, who seeing the Child,
said, <i>This poor Child is bewitched; and you have a
Neighbour living not far off who is a Witch</i>. He
added, <i>Your Neighbour has had a falling out with
your Wife; and she said in her heart, your Wife is
a proud Woman, and she would bring down her pride
in this Child</i>: He then remembered, that <i>Bishop</i>
had parted from his Wife in muttering, and
menacing terms, a little before the Child was
taken ill. The abovesaid stranger would needs
carry the bewitched Boy with him to <i>Bishops</i>
House, on pretence of buying a Pot of Cyder.
The Woman entertained him in a furious manner;
and flew also upon the Boy, scratching his face
till the Blood came, and saying, <i>Thou Rogue,
what? dost thou bring this fellow here to plague me?</i>
Now it seems the Man had said before he went,
that he would fetch Blood of her. Ever after
the Boy was followed with grievous Fits, which
the Doctors themselves generally ascribed unto
Witchcraft; and wherein he would be thrown
still into the Fire or Water, if he were not constantly
looked after; and it was verily believed
that <i>Bishop</i> was the cause of it.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>10. <i>John Louder</i> testified, that upon some little
controversie with <i>Bishop</i> about her Fowls, going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>well to bed, he did awake in the Night by Moonlight,
and did clearly see the likeness of this Woman
grievously oppressing him. In which miserable
condition she held him unable to help
himself, till near day. He told <i>Bishop</i> of this;
but she utterly denied it, and threatned him very
much. Quickly after this, being at home on a
Lord's Day, with the doors shut about him, he
saw a black Pig approach him; at which he going
to kick, it vanished away. Immediately
after sitting down he saw a black thing jump in
at the Window, and come and stand before him.
The body was like that of a Monkey, the feet
like a Cocks, but the face much like a Mans.
He being so extremely afrighted, that he could
not speak; this Monster spoke to him and said,
<i>I am a Messenger</i> [124] <i>sent unto you, for I understand
that you are in some trouble of Mind, and if
you will be ruled by me, you shall want for nothing
in this World.</i> Whereupon he endeavoured to
clap his hands upon it; but he could feel no substance,
and it jumped out of the Window again;
but immediately came in by the Porch, though
the doors were shut, and said, <i>You had better take
my counsel!</i> He then struck at it with a stick,
but struck only the Groundsel, and broke the
stick. The Arm with which he struck was presently
disenabled, and it vanished away. He
presently went out at the back door, and spied
this <i>Bishop</i>, in her Orchard, going toward her
House; but he had not power to set one foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
forward unto her. Whereupon returning into
the House, he was immediately accosted by the
Monster he had seen before; which Goblin was
now going to fly at him: whereat he cried out,
<i>The whole Armour of God be between me and you!</i>
so it sprang back, and flew over the Apple-tree;
shaking many Apples off the Tree in its flying
over. At its leap, it flung dirt with its Feet,
against the Stomach of the Man; whereon he
was then struck dumb, and so continued for three
Days together. Upon the producing of this
Testimony, <i>Bishop</i> denied that she knew this Deponent.
Yet their two Orchards joined, and they
had often had their little quarrels for some Years
together.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>11. <i>William Stacy</i> testified, that receiving Money
of this <i>Bishop</i>, for work done by him, he was gone
but a matter of three Rods from her, and looking
for his Money, found it unaccountably gone from
him. Some time after, <i>Bishop</i> asked him whether
his Father would grind her Grist for her?
He demanded why? she replied, because folks
count me a Witch. He answered, no question,
but he will grind it for you; being then gone
about six Rods from her, with a small load in his
Cart, suddainly the off Wheel slumpt, and sunk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
down into an hole, upon plain ground, so that the
Deponent, was forced to get help for the recovering
of the Wheel. But stepping back to look
for the hole which might give him this disaster,
there was none at all to be found. Some time
after he was waked in the Night; but it seemed
as light as day, and he perfectly saw the shape of
this <i>Bishop</i>, in the Room troubling of him, but
upon her going out, all was dark again. He
charg'd <i>Bishop</i> afterwards with it, and she denied
it not; but was very angry. Quickly after, this
Deponent having been threatned by <i>Bishop</i>, as he
was in a dark Night going to the Barn, he was
very suddenly taken or lifted from the ground
and thrown against a Stone-wall; after that he
was again hoisted up, and thrown down a bank,
at the end of his House. After this, again passing
by this <i>Bishop</i>, his Horse with a small load,
striving to draw, all his Gears flew to pieces, and
the Cart fell down; and this Deponent going
then to lift a bag of Corn, of about two Bushels,
could not budge it with all his might.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>[125] Many other pranks of this <i>Bishops</i>, this
Deponent was ready to testifie. He also testified,
that he verily believed, the said <i>Bishop</i> was the

Instrument of his Daughter <i>Priscilla's</i> death; of
which suspicion, pregnant reasons were assigned.</p>

<p>12. To crown all <i>John Bly</i> and <i>William Bly</i>
testified, that being employ'd by <i>Bridget Bishop</i>,
to help take down the Cellar-wall of the old
House, wherein she formerly lived, they did in
holes of the said old Wall, find several Poppets
made up of Rags, and Hogs Bristles, with headless
Pins in them, the points being outward.
Whereof she could now give no Account unto the
Court, that was reasonable or tolerable.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>13. One thing that made against the Prisoner
was, her being evidently convicted of Gross lying
in the Court, several times, while she was making
her Plea. But besides this, a Jury of Women,
found a preternatural Tet upon her Body; but
upon a second search, within three or four hours,
there was no such thing to be seen. There was
also an Account of other People whom this Woman
had Afflicted. And there might have been
many more, if they had been enquired for. But
there was no need of them.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>14. There was one very strange thing more,
with which the Court was newly entertained. As
this Woman was under a guard, passing by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
great and spacious Meeting House of <i>Salem</i>, she
gave a look towards the House; and immediately
a <i>Dæmon</i> invisibly entring the Meeting House,
Tore down a part of it; so that tho there were
no person to be seen there, yet the People at the
Noise running in, found a board which was
strongly fastened with several Nails, transported
unto another quarter of the House.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_70_70" id="Footnote_70_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_70_70"><span class="label">[70]</span></a> The Answers of Bridget at
her Examination were Common-sense-like,
and carried with them
such honest Simplicity, that it is
Matter of Astonishment the Judges
could not distinguish between the
most puerile Absurdities and Truth.
It appears that she had had a Husband,
named Oliver; hence she is
often called Bridget Bishop, alias
Oliver. During her Examination,
the Afflicted apparently suffered excessive
Torture. One "Sam. Gold"
afterwards asked her if she was not
troubled to see them so tormented.
He reported that her Answer was
"No. She was not troubled for
them." This was viewed as strong
Evidence against her.</p></div>

that of "Sus. Sheldon" was perhaps
equal to any. She was about
18 Years old. At one Time, June
2d, 1692, she saw the "Apperishtion"
of Bridget Bishop, and immediately
came two little Children,
Twins, which told her (Bridget) to
her Face that she had murdered
them by setting them into Fits,
whereof they dyed. One John
Cooke, aged 18, swore about an
Apple which jumped out of his
Hand. John <i>Blye</i> and his Wife,
about a Sow of theirs being bewitched,
and they "Judged Bishop
bewitched said Sow." Elizabeth
Balch of Beverly, aged about 38,
Wife of Benj. B. Ju<sup>r</sup>, "being at Salem y<sup>e</sup> very Day that Capt George
Corwin was buried, and in y<sup>e</sup>
Euening of said Day coming from sd.
Salem vnto sd. Beuerly, on Horseback,
with her Sister, then known
by the Name of Abigail Woodburie,
now Abigail Waldron lieuing
in Wenham, Wife vnto Nathaniell
Waldron, riding behinde her; and
were come so far as Crane Riuer
Common soe called, Edward Bishop
and his Wife ouertook vs (on
horseback) who are both now in
Prison vnder Suspition of Witchcraft."
Bridget complained of her
Husband for riding into the Water,
and of riding too fast. Whereupon
an Altercation arose, and hard
Words were bandied between them.
"And then sd. Bishop directed his
Speech vnto vs as we rode along,
and sd. that she had been a bad
Wife vnto him euer since they were
marryed, and reckoned vp many of
her Miscarriages towards him; but
now of late she was worse than
euer before (and that the she Devill
did come bodyly vnto her, and that
she was familiar with the Deuil, and
that she sate vp all ye Night long

<p><a name="Footnote_72_72" id="Footnote_72_72"></a><a href="#FNanchor_72_72"><span class="label">[72]</span></a> "Sus. Sheldon," in additional
Testimony said, that "on the fourth
Day, at Night, came Goody Olliuer,
Mrs. English, Goodman Corie,
and a black Man with a hi crowned
hatt, with Books in their Hands.
Goody Olliuer bid me touch her
Book. I would not;" told me she
had been a Witch twenty Years.
"Then there came a streacked
Snake, creeping ouer her Shoulder,
and creep into her Bosom. Mrs.
English had a Yello Bird in her
Bosom, and Goodman Corie had
two Turcles hang to his Coat, and
he opened his Bosom and put his
Turcles to his Brest and gave them
suck. Then Goodm. Core and
Goody Oliuer kneeled downe before
the Black Man and went to
prayer. The Black Man told me
Goody Olliver had been a Witch
20 years and an half. Then they
all set to biting mee, and so went
away. Goodwife Core told me
she lived in [B]osston Prison. Then
she pulled out her brest and the
Black Man gave her a thing like a
blake Pig. It had no Hairs on it.
Shee put it to her brest and gave it
suck. Goody Olliver told mee shee
had killed four Women. Two of
them were the Fosters Wifes and
John Traskes Wife, and did not name the other. Then they did all
bite mee."&mdash;<i>Records S. W.</i> ii, 169-170.

Warrant" of Bridget Bishop, dated
at Boston, June the 8th, 1692,

three and an half of Mr. Woodward's
quarto Pages. His Age was
41. A part of his Story reminds
one of the Man who appeared
among his friends with an awfully
bruised Face. On being asked how
it happened, replied that the Stones
in the Road flew up and struck him
as he was walking along. Poor
Shattuck was unquestionably injured

<p><a name="Footnote_79_79" id="Footnote_79_79"></a><a href="#FNanchor_79_79"><span class="label">[79]</span></a> John Louder gave his Age
"about thirty two." He said he
lived with Mr. John Gedney in
Salem about seven or eight Years
since. He was doubtless afflicted
by the same Agents as Samuel Shattuck
was, and saw quite as much if
not hurt as much. A black Pig
seemed determined to keep him
Company; but there were some
other Things equally nondescript.

six, or thereabouts. He goes back
fourteen Years, which was the time
of the Money Transaction. So
that Dr. Mather's version of the
Affair, as though it had just happened,
is not a fair one. Stacy was
often in the same Predicament of
Shattuck and Louder, only Stone
Fences, Stumps and other odd
things knocked him about in a
manner, which if it surprised the
Magistrates, it probably surprised
nobody who might be better acquainted

so to bewilder and confound
Persons of firmer nerves than an
aged Matron, and thus make them
contradict themselves, not knowing
what to say and hardly what was

<h3>The Trial of <i>Susanna Martin, June</i> 29,
1692. As is Printed, in <i>Wonders of the
Invisible World</i>, from p. 114 to p. 116.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap"><span class="dropfix">1.</span>&nbsp;S</span><i>USANNA Martin</i>, pleading not Guilty,
to the Indictment of Witchcrafts brought
in against her; there were produced the Evidences
of many persons very sensibly and grievously
bewitched; who all complained of the Prisoner
at the Bar, as the person whom they believed the
cause of their Miseries. And now as well as in
the other Trials, there was an extraordinary endeavour
by Witchcrafts, with cruel and frequent
Fits, to hinder the poor Sufferers, from giving in
their Complaints; which the Court was forced
with much patience to obtain, by much waiting
and watching for it.</p>

<p>There was now also an Account given, of what
had passed at her first Examination before the
Magistrates. The cast of her Eye then striking
the Afflicted People to the Ground, whether they
saw that cast or no: There were these among
other Passages between the Magistrates and the
Examinate.</p>

<p><i>Magistrate.</i> Pray, what ails these People?</p>

<p><i>Martin.</i> I don't know.</p>

<p><i>Magist.</i> But, What do you think ails them?</p>

<p><i>Martin.</i> I don't desire to spend my Judgment
upon it.</p>

<p><i>Magist.</i> Don't you think they are bewitched?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p><i>Martin.</i> No, I do not think they are.</p>

<p><i>Magist.</i> Tell us your thoughts about them
then.</p>

<p><i>Martin.</i> No, my thoughts are my own when
they are in, but when they are out, they are anothers.
Their Master&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Magist.</i> Their Master; Who do you think is
their Master?</p>

<p><i>Martin.</i> If they be dealing in the black Art,
you may know as well as I.</p>

<p>[127] <i>Magist.</i> Well, what have you done towards
this?</p>

<p><i>Martin.</i> Nothing at all.</p>

<p><i>Magist.</i> Why, 'tis you or your appearance.</p>

<p><i>Martin.</i> I can't help it.</p>

<p><i>Magist.</i> Is it not your Master? How comes
your appearance to hurt these?</p>

<p><i>Martin.</i> How do I know? He that appeared
in the shape of <i>Samuel</i>, a Glorified Saint may appear
in any ones shape.</p>

<p>It was then also noted in her, as in others like
her, that if the Afflicted went to approach her,
they were flung down to the ground. And, when
she was asked the reason of it, she said, I cannot
tell, it may be, the Devil bears me more Malice
than another.&mdash;</p>

<p>The Court accounted themselves Alarm'd by
these things, to inquire further into the Conversation
of the Prisoner; and see what there might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
occur, to render these Accusations further credible.<a name="FNanchor_a_a" id="FNanchor_a_a"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_a" class="fnanchor">a</a>

Whereupon <i>John Allen</i>, of <i>Salisbury</i> testified,
that he refusing, because of the weakness of
his Oxen, to Cart some Staves at the request of
this <i>Martin</i>, she was displeased at it, and said, <i>It
had been as good that he had; for his Oxen should
never do him much more service</i>. Whereupon this
Deponent said, <i>Dost thou threaten me, thou old
Witch? I'll throw thee into the Brook</i>: which to
avoid, she flew over the Bridge and escaped.
But as he was going home, one of his Oxen tired,
so that he was forced to unyoke him, that he
might get him home. He then put his Oxen
with many more, upon <i>Salisbury-Beach</i>, where
Cattle did use to get Flesh. In a few Days, all
the Oxen upon the <i>Beach</i> were found by their
Tracks, to have run unto the mouth of <i>Merrimack-River</i>
and not returned; but the next day
they were found come ashore upon <i>Plum-Island</i>.
They that sought them, used all imaginable gentleness,
but they would still run away with a
violence, that seemed wholly Diabolical, till they
came near the mouth of <i>Merrimack-River</i>; when
they ran right into the Sea, swimming as far as
they could be seen. One of them then swam
back again, with a swiftness amazing to the beholders,
who stood ready to receive them, and
help up his tired Carcass: but the Beast ran furiously
up into the Island, and from thence thorough
the Marishes, up into <i>Newbury</i> Town, and so up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>into the Woods; and there after a while found near
<i>Amesbury</i>. So that of Fourteen good Oxen,
there was only this saved: the rest were all cast
up, some in one place, and some in another,
Drowned.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>4. <i>John Atkinson</i> testified, that he exchanged a
Cow, with a Son of <i>Susanna Martins</i>, whereat
she muttered, and was unwilling he should have
it. Going to receive this Cow, tho he Hamstring'd
her, and halter'd her, she of a tame Creature
grew so mad, that they could scarce get her
along. She broke all the Ropes that were fastened
unto her, and tho she was tied [128] fast
unto a Tree, yet she made her escape, and gave
them such further trouble, as they could ascribe
to no cause but Witchcraft.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>5. <i>Bernard Peache</i> testified that being in Bed,
on a Lords Day Night, he heard a scrabbling at
the Window, whereat he then saw <i>Susanna Martin</i>
come in, and jump down upon the floor. She
took hold of this Deponents Feet, and drawing
his body up into an heap, she lay upon him near
two hours; in all which time he could neither
speak nor stir. At length when he could begin
to move he laid hold on her hand, and pulling it
up to his mouth, he bit three of her Fingers as
he judged to the Bone. Whereupon she went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>from the Chamber down the Stairs, out at the
door. This Deponent thereupon called unto the
people of the House to advise them of what
passed; and he himself did follow her. The People
saw her not; but there being a Bucket at the
Left hand of the door, there was a drop of Blood
on it; and several more drops of Blood upon the
Snow, newly fallen abroad. There was likewise
the print of her two Feet, just without the
Threshold; but no more sign of any footing further
off.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>At another time this Deponent was desired by
the Prisoner, to come unto a husking of Corn, at
her House; and she said, <i>If he did not come, it
were better that he did</i>! He went not; but the
night following, <i>Susanna Martin</i>, as he judged,
and another came towards him. One of them
said, <i>here he is</i>! but he, having a Quarterstaff,
made a blow at them. The Roof of the Barn
broke his blow; but following them to the Window,
he made another blow at them, and struck
them down; yet they got up, and got out, and
he saw no more of them.</p>

<p>About this time, there was a Rumour about
the Town, that <i>Martin</i> had a broken head; but
the Deponent could say nothing to that.</p>

<p>The said <i>Peache</i> also testified, the bewitching
of Cattle to Death, upon<i> Martin's</i> discontents.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>
<p>6. <i>Robert Downer</i> testified, that this Prisoner
being some years ago prosecuted at Court for a
Witch, he then said unto her, <i>He believed she was
a Witch</i>. Whereat she being disatisfied, said,
<i>That some she Devil would shortly fetch him away</i>;
which words were heard by others, as well as
himself; the night following, as he lay in his
Bed, there came in at the Window, the likeness
of a Cat, which flew upon him, and took fast
hold of his Throat, lay on him a considerable
while, and almost killed him; at length he remembered
what <i>Susanna Martin</i> had threatened
the Day before, and with much striving, he
cried out, <i>Avoid thou the Devil, In the name of
God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, avoid</i>:
Whereupon it left him, leaped on the Floor, and
flew out at the Window.</p>

<p>And there also came in several Testimonies that
before ever <i>Downer</i> spoke a word of this Accident,
<i>Susanna Martin</i> and her Family had related
how this <i>Downer</i> had been handled.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>[129] 7. <i>John Kembal</i> testified, that <i>Susanna
Martin</i>, upon a causeless disgust had threatned
him about a certain Cow of his, that she should
never do him any more good, and it came to
pass accordingly; for soon after the Cow was
found stark dead on the dry ground, without any
Distemper to be discerned upon her. Upon
which he was followed with a strange death upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>more of his Cattle. Whereof he lost in one
Spring, to the value of 30<i>l.</i> But the said <i>John
Kembal</i>, had a further Testimony to give in
against the Prisoner, which was truly admirable.
Being desirous to furnish himself with a Dog, he
applied himself to buy one of this <i>Martin</i>, who
had a Bitch with Whelps in her House, but she
not letting him have his choice; he said, <i>He
would supply himself then at one</i> Blezdels. Having
mark'd a Puppy which he liked at <i>Blezdels</i>, he
met George Martin, the Husband of the Prisoner
going by, who asked whether he would not have
one of his Wives Puppy's; and he answered, No.
The same Day one <i>Edmund Eliot</i>,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> being at <i>Martins</i>
House heard <i>George Martin</i> relate where this
<i>Kembal</i> had been, and what he had said; whereupon
<i>Susanna Martin</i> reply'd, <i>If I live I'll give
him Puppies enough</i>. Within a few days after this,
<i>Kembal</i> coming out of the Woods, there arose a
little black Cloud in the <i>N. W.</i> and <i>Kembal</i> immediately
felt a force upon him, which made him
not able to avoid running upon the stumps of
Trees that were before him, albeit he had a
broad plain cart way before him; but tho he had
his Axe also on his Shoulder to endanger him in
his falls, he could not forbear going out of his
way to tumble over them. When he came below
the Meeting-House, there appeared unto him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>a little thing like a Puppy of a darkish Colour, and
it shot backwards and forwards between his Legs.
He had the Courage to use all possible endeavours
of cutting it with his Axe, but he could not hit it;
the Puppy gave a jump from him and went, as to
him it seem'd into the Ground. Going a little
further there appeared unto him a black Puppy,
somewhat bigger than the First, but as black as a
Coal. It's motions were quicker than those of
his Axe. It flew at his Belly, and away at his
Throat, so over his Shoulders one way, and then
over his Shoulders another way, his heart now
began to fail him, and he thought the Dog would
have tore his Throat out. But he recovered
himself, and called upon God in his distress, and
naming the name of Jesus Christ it vanished
away at once. The Deponent spoke not one
word of these Accidents, for fear of affrighting
his Wife. But the next morning, <i>Edmund Eliot</i>
going into <i>Martins</i> house, this Woman asked him,
where <i>Kembal</i> was? He replied, at home a Bed,
for ought he knew. She returned; they say he
was frighted last night. <i>Eliot</i> asked with what?
She answered with Puppies. <i>Eliot</i> asked, where
she heard of it, for he had heard nothing of it!
She rejoined, about the Town. Altho' <i>Kembal</i>
had mentioned the matter to no creature living.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
[130] 8. <i>William Brown</i> testified, that Heaven
having bless'd him with a most Pious and Prudent
Wife, this Wife of his, one day met with <i>Susanna
Martin</i>: but when she approached just unto
her, <i>Martin</i> vanished out of sight, and left her
extreamly affrighted. After which time the said
<i>Martin</i> often appeared unto her, giving her no
little trouble; and when she did come, she was
visited with Birds that sorely peck'd and prick'd
her; and sometimes a bunch like a Pullets Egg
would rise on her Throat, ready to choak her, till
she cry'd out, <i>Witch, you shan't choak me!</i> While
this good Woman was in this Extremity, the
Church appointed a Day of Prayer on her behalf;
whereupon the trouble ceas'd; she saw not
<i>Martin</i> as formerly; and the Church instead of
their Fast, gave thanks for her deliverance. But
a considerable while after, she being summoned
to give in some Evidence at the Court, against
this <i>Martin</i>, quickly this <i>Martin</i> came behind
her, while she was Milking her Cow, and said
unto her, <i>For thy defaming me at Court, I'll make
thee the miserablest Creature in the World.</i> Soon
after which she fell into a strange kind of Distemper,
and became horribly Frantick, and uncapable
of any Reasonable Action, the Physicians
declaring, that her Distemper was preternatural,
and that some Devil had certainly bewitched her;
and in that condition she now remained.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
9. <i>Sarah Atkinson</i> testified, that <i>Susanna Martin</i>
came from <i>Amesbury</i>, to their House at <i>Newbury</i>,
in an extraordinary Season, when it was not
fit for any one to Travel. She came (as she said
unto <i>Atkinson</i>) all that long way on foot. She
bragg'd and show'd how dry she was; nor could
it be perceived that so much as the Soles of her
Shoes were wet. <i>Atkinson</i> was amazed at it, and
professed, that she should herself have been wet
up to the Knees, if she had then come so far;
but <i>Martin</i> reply'd, <i>She scorned to be drabbled!</i>
It was noted that this Testimony upon her Tryal,
cast her into a very singular confusion.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>10. <i>John Pressy</i> testified, that being one Evening
very unaccountably bewildred near a Field
of <i>Martin</i>, and several times as one under an Enchantment,
returning to the place he had left, at
length he saw a Marvellous light, about the bigness
of an half Bushel, near two Rood out of the
way. He went and struck at it with a Stick, and
laid it on with all his might. He gave it near
Forty blows; and felt it a palpable substance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>But going from it, his heels were struck up, and
he was laid with his back on the ground; sliding
as he thought into a Pit: from whence he recovered,
by taking hold on the Bush; altho afterwards
he could find no such Pit in the place.
Having after his recovery, gone five or six Rood,
he saw <i>Susanna Martin</i> standing on his Left hand,
as the Light had done before; but they changed
no words with one another. He could scarce
find his House in his return; but at length he
got home, extreamly af[131]frighted. The next
Day it was upon enquiry understood, that <i>Martin</i>
was in a miserable condition by pains and hurts
that were upon her.</p>

<p>It was further testified by this Deponent, that
after he had given in some Evidence against <i>Susanna
Martin</i> many Years ago, she gave him foul
words about it, and said, <i>He should never prosper,
more particularly, that he should never have more
than two Cows: that tho he were never so likely to
have more, yet he should never have them.</i> And
that from that very day to this; namely for
Twenty Years together, he could never exceed
that number; but some strange thing or other
still prevented his having of any more.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>11. <i>Jarvis Ring</i> testified that about Seven Years
ago he was oftentimes grievously oppressed in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>Night; but saw not who troubled him, until at
last he lying perfectly awake, plainly saw <i>Susanna
Martin</i> approach him. She came to him and
forcibly bit him by the Finger; so that the print
of the bite is now so long after to be seen upon
him.</p>

<p>12. But besides all these Evidences, there was
a most wonderful Account of one <i>Joseph Ring</i>
produced on this occasion. This Man has been
strangely carried about by <i>Dæmons</i>. From one
Witch-meeting to another, for near two Years
together; and for one quarter of this time they
made him and kept him Dumb, though he is
now again able to speak. There was one <i>T. H.</i><a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
who having, as 'tis judged, a design of Engaging
this <i>Joseph Ring</i> in a snare of Devilism, contrived
a while, to bring this <i>Ring</i> two Shillings in Debt
unto him. Afterwards this poor Man would be
visited with unknown shapes, and this <i>T. H.</i>
sometimes among them; which would force him
away with them, unto unknown places, where he
saw Meetings, Feastings, Dancings; and after his
return wherein they hurried him along thro the
Air, he gave demonstrations to the Neighbours,
that he had indeed been so transported. When
he was brought unto these hellish meetings, one
of the first things they still did unto him, was to
give him a knock on the back, whereupon he
was ever as if bound with Chains, uncapable of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>stirring out of the place, till they should release
him. He related, that there often came to him
a Man, who presented him a Book, whereto he
would have him set his hand; promising to him
that he should then have even what he would;
and presenting him with all the delectable things,
persons, and places, that he could imagine. But
he refusing to subscribe, the business would end
with dreadful shapes, noises and screeches, which
almost scared him out of his wits. Once with a
Book, there was a Pen offer'd him, and an Inkhorn,
with liquor in it, that seem'd like Blood:
but he never touched it.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>This Man did now affirm, that he saw the
Prisoner at several of those hellish Randezvouzes.</p>

<p>[132] <i>Note</i>&mdash;This Woman was one of the
most Impudent, Scurrilous, wicked Creature in
the World; and she did now throughout her
whole Tryal, discover herself to be such an one.
Yet when she was asked what she had to say for
herself, her chief plea was, that she had led a
most vertuous and holy life.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap"><span class="dropfix">1.</span>&nbsp; E</span><i>LIZABETH How</i>, pleading, not Guilty
to the Indictment of Witchcrafts, then
charged upon her; the Court, according to the
usual proceeding of the Courts in <i>England</i>; in
such Cases, began with hearing the Deposition of
several Afflicted People, who were grievously
tormented by sensible and evident Witchcrafts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>and all complained of the Prisoner, as the cause
of their trouble. It was also found that the
Suffers were not able to bear her look, as likewise,
that in their greatest swoons, they distinguished
her touch from other Peoples, being
thereby raised out of them.</p>

<p>And there was other Testimony of People to
whom the shape of this <i>How</i>, gave trouble Nine
or Ten Years ago.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>2. It has been a most usual thing for the bewitched
persons at the same time that the Spectres
representing the Witches, Troubled them to
be visited with Apparitions of Ghosts, pretending
to have been murdered by the Witches then represented.
And sometimes the confessions of the
Witches afterwards acknowledged those very
Murders, which these Apparitions charged upon
them; altho they had never heard what Information
had been given by the Sufferers.</p>

<p>There was such Apparitions of Ghosts testified
by some of the present Sufferers, and the Ghosts
affirmed that this <i>How</i> had murdered them:
which things were fear'd, but not proved.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>3. This <i>How</i> had made some attempts of Joining
to the Church at <i>Ipswich</i>, several Years ago;
but she was denied an Admission into that holy
Society, partly thro a suspicion of Witchcraft,
then urged against her. And there now came
in Testimony of preternatural Mischiefs, presently
befalling some that had been Instrumental to debar
her from the Communion whereupon she was
intruding.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
4. There was a particular Deposition of <i>Joseph
Safford</i>, that his Wife had conceived an extream
Aversion, to this <i>How</i>, on the reports of her
Witchcrafts; but <i>How</i> one day taking her by the
hand, and saying, <i>I believe you are not Ignorant of
the great scandal, that I lye under, by an Evil report
raised upon me</i>. She immediately, unreasonably,
and unperswadeably, even like one Inchanted,
began to take this Womans part. <i>How</i>
being soon after propounded, as desiring an Admission
to the Table of the Lord, some of the
Pious Brethren were unsatisfied about her. The
Elders appointed a meeting to hear matters objected
against her; and no arguments in the
World could hinder this Goodwife <i>Safford</i> from
going to the Lecture. She did indeed promise
with much ado that she would not go to the
Church-meeting; yet she could not refrain going
thither also. [134] <i>How</i>'s affairs there were so canvassed,
that she came off rather Guilty, than cleared;
nevertheless Goodwife <i>Safford</i> could not forbear
taking her by the Hand, and saying, <i>Tho you are
condemned before Men, you are justified before God</i>.
She was quickly taken in a very strange manner;
Frantick, Raving, Raging, and crying out, <i>Goody</i>
How <i>must come into the Church; she is a precious
Saint, and tho' she be condemned before Men, she is
justified before God</i>. So she continued for the
space of two or three hours; and then fell into
a Trance. But coming to herself, she cried out,
<i>Ha! I was mistaken!</i> afterwards again repeated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
<i>Ha! I was mistaken!</i> being asked by a stander
by, Wherein? she replied, <i>I thought Goody</i> How
<i>had been a precious Saint of God, but now I see she
is a Witch: she has bewitched me and my Child, and
we shall never be well, till there be Testimony for
her, that she may be taken into the Church.</i><a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>And <i>How</i> said afterwards, <i>That she was very
sorry to see</i> Safford <i>at the Church-meeting mentioned.
Safford</i> after this, <i>declared herself to be Afflicted by
the shape of</i> How, <i>and from that shape she endured
many miseries.</i></p>

<p>5. <i>John How</i>, Brother to the Husband of the
Prisoner testified that he refusing to accompany
the Prisoner unto her Examination as was by her
desired, immediately some of his Cattle, were
bewitched to Death, leaping Three or four Foot
high, turning about, squeaking, falling and dying
at once; and going to cut off an Ear, for an use,
that might as well perhaps have been omitted,
the Hand wherein he held his Knife was taken
very Numb; and so it remained, and full of pain
for several Days; being not well at this very
time. And he suspected this Prisoner, for the
Author of it.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>6. <i>Nehemiah Abbot</i> testified, that unusual and
mischievous accidents would befall his Cattle,
whenever he had any difference with this Prisoner.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>Once particularly she wished his Ox choaked, and
within a little while, that Ox was choaked with
a Turnip in his Throat. At another time, refusing
to lend his Horse, at the request of her
Daughter, the Horse was in a preternatural manner
abused. And several other odd things of that
kind were testified.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>7. There came in Testimony that one Goodwife
<i>Sherwin</i>, upon some difference with <i>How</i>
was bewitched, and, that she died, charging this
<i>How</i> of having an hand in her Death. And that
other People had their Barrels of Drink unaccountably
mischiev'd, spoiled, and spilt upon their
displeasing her.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>The things in themselves were trivial; but
there being such a course of them, it made them
the more to be considered. Among others, <i>Martha
Wood</i> gave her testimony, that a little after,
her Father had been employed in gathering an
account of this <i>How's</i> Conversation, they once
and again lost great quantities of Drink, out of
their Vessels, in such a [135] manner, as they
could ascribe to nothing but Witchcraft. As also
that <i>How</i> giving her some Apples, when she had
eaten of them, she was taken with a very strange
kind of a maze, insomuch that she knew not
what she said or did.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>

8. There was likewise a Cluster of Depositions,
that one <i>Isaac Cummings</i>, refusing to lend his
Mare, unto the Husband of this <i>How</i>; the Mare
was within a Day or two taken in a strange condition.
The beast seemed much abused; being
bruised, as if she had been running over the
Rocks, and marked where the Bridle went, as if
burnt with a red hot Bridle. Moreover one using
a Pipe of Tobacco for the cure of the Beast, a
blew flame issued out of her, took hold of her
hair, and not only spread and burnt on her, but
it also flew upwards towards the Roof of the
Barn, and had like to have set the Barn on fire.
And the Mare dy'd very suddenly.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>9. <i>Timothy Perly</i> and his Wife, testified, not
only that unaccountable Mischiefs befel their
Cattle, upon their having of differences with this
Prisoner; but also that they had a Daughter destroyed
by Witchcrafts; which Daughter still
charged <i>How</i>, as the cause of her Affliction; and
it was noted that she would be struck down,
whenever <i>How</i> were spoken of. She was often
endeavoured to be thrown into the Fire, and into
the Water, in her strange Fitts; tho her Father
had corrected, for charging <i>How</i> with bewitching
her, yet (as was testified by others also) she said
she was sure of it, and must dye standing to it.
Accordingly she charged <i>How</i> to the very death;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>and said, <i>Tho</i> How <i>could Afflict and Torment her
Body, yet she could not hurt her Soul, and that the
truth of this matter would appear when she should
be dead and gone</i>.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>10. <i>Francis Lane</i> testified, that being hired by
the Husband of this <i>How</i> to get him a parcel of
Posts and Rails, this <i>Lane</i> hired <i>John Pearly</i> to
assist him. This Prisoner then told <i>Lane</i> that she
believed the Posts and Rails would not do, because
<i>John Pearly</i> helped him; but that if he had got
them alone without <i>John Pearly</i>'s help, they
might have done well enough. When <i>James
How</i> came to receive his Posts and Rails of <i>Lane</i>,
<i>How</i> taking them up by the Ends, they, tho good
and sound yet unaccountably broke off, so that <i>Lane</i>
was forced to get Thirty or Forty more. And
this Prisoner being informed of it, she said, <i>She
told him so before: because</i> Pearly <i>helped about
them</i>.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>11. Afterwards there came in the Confessions
of several other (penitent) Witches, which affirmed
this <i>How</i> to be one of those who with them had
been baptized by the Devil in the River, at <i>Newberry-Falls</i>:
before which he made them there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>kneel down by the Brink of the River, and
Worship him.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

The Indictment does not appear
in the <span class="err" title="original: Reeords">Records</span>, probably for
the Reason that it had been given
to or taken by Dr. Mather, and
never returned. Mrs. How was of
Topsfield, Wife of James How of
that Town. Ephraim Wildes was
the Constable who apprehended her.
Her Examination was on the 30th
of May, 1692, occupies two Pages,
and was taken down by Mr. "Sam.
Parris."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_97_97" id="Footnote_97_97"></a><a href="#FNanchor_97_97"><span class="label">[97]</span></a> The Author has not taken up
the respective Parties who gave Evidence.
Among others, no Notice
is taken of that of two Ministers,
namely, Mr. Samuel Phillips and
Mr. Edward Payson, both of Rowley.
Mr. Phillips gave his Age as
about 67. Mr. <i>Paison</i> did not
state his. Their Testimonies were
passed over undoubtedly because
they did not in the least criminate
Mrs. How; nor did they pretend
that they had seen any Thing like
Witchcraft.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_98_98" id="Footnote_98_98"></a><a href="#FNanchor_98_98"><span class="label">[98]</span></a> They were not only not proved,
but there are no Testimonies recorded
containing these Ghost Stories.
The following Witnesses are
not noticed by Dr. Mather, viz.:
Samuel Perley, aged about 52, and his Wife about 46. Deborah Hadley,
aged about 70 Years; had lived
near Elizabeth How ("ye Wife of
James How, Jr. of Ipswich 24
year.") She gave her a good Character.
Mrs. Hadley testified on
the 24th of June. The next Day
Daniel Warner, Sen. gave in his
Testimony. It was of the same
tenor of Mrs. Hadley's. John
Warner, Sen<sup>r</sup>. also signed the same
Evidence. They had been well
acquainted with Mrs. How "aboue
20 yeers." So Simon Chapman
and his Wife testified. Simon gave
his Age as about 48&mdash;"hath ben
aquainted with the Wiuef of James
How, iun<sup>r</sup>. as a Naybar for this 9
or 10 Yers;" never knew any harm
of her, and "found hur joust in
hur delling, faythfooll," &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_99_99" id="Footnote_99_99"></a><a href="#FNanchor_99_99"><span class="label">[99]</span></a> Against such gratuitous, and to
say the least, hearsay Testimony,
the Doctor should, in fairness, have
noticed such Evidence as that referred
to in the last Note. A few
others must not be overlooked.
Joseph Knowlton stated that he had
been acquainted with Mrs. How,
as a Neighbor, and sometimes
boarded in the House at his first
coming to live in these Parts, which
was about ten Years ago. He and
his Wife Mary both gave her a
good Character. His Age was
"forty tu," and his Wife's "thurty-tu."
</p>
<p>
James How, Sen., aged about 94,
testified that he had lived by Elizabeth,
the Wife of James How,
Jun<sup>r</sup>, for about thirty Years; and,
"setting a side humain Infurmity,"
she always behaved well, becoming
her Place as a Daughter and Wife
in all Relations.
</p>
<p>
Respecting the Church Difficulty,
referred to in the Text, one Jacob
Foster, aged about 29, swore, that
"some Years agoe," as Goodwife
How was about to join the Church,
his Father was a Means of preventing
it. Whereupon his Mare was
lost for several Days. When found
she looked as if she had been miserably
beaten and abused. Sworn
June 30th, 1692. Thomas Andrews
of Boxford, aged about 50,
told a more ridiculous Story about
a Mare, belonging to Josiah Comings,
Sen<sup>r</sup> of Topsfield.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_100_100" id="Footnote_100_100"></a><a href="#FNanchor_100_100"><span class="label">[100]</span></a> Joseph Safford gave his Age

his Sow that "leaped up about three

dead. The <i>squeaking</i> belonged to
the Swine, and not to the Cattle.</p></div>

<h3>The Trial of <i>Martha Carryer</i>, August 2,
1692. As may be seen in <i>Wonders of
the Invisible World</i>, from P. 132, to
138.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap"><span class="dropfix">1.</span>&nbsp; M</span><i>Artha Carryer</i> was indicted for the bewitching
of certain persons according to
the form usual in such Cases: Pleading not Guilty
to her Indictment; there were first brought in a
considerable number of the Bewitched persons;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
who not only made the Court sensible of an horrid
Witchcraft committed upon them, but also
deposed, That it was <i>Martha Carryer</i>, or her
shape, that grievously tormented them by biting,
pricking, pinching and choaking them. It was
further deposed that while this <i>Carryer</i> was on
her Examination before the Magistrates, the poor
People were so tortured, that every one expected
their Death upon the very spot; but that upon
the binding of <i>Carryer</i> they were eased. [137]
Moreover the looks of <i>Carryer</i> then laid the
Afflicted People for dead, and her Touch, if her
Eyes at the same time were off them, raised them
again. Which things were also now seen upon
her Tryal. And it was testified, that upon the
mention of some having their Necks twisted almost
round by the shape of this <i>Carryer</i>, she
replied, <i>Its no matter, tho their Necks had been
twisted quite off</i>.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>2. Before the Tryal of this Prisoner, several
of her own Children had frankly and fully confessed
not only that they were Witches themselves,
but that this their Mother had made them
so. This confession they made with great shows
of Repentance, and with much Demonstration of
Truth. They related Place, Time, Occasion; they
gave an Account of Journeys, Meetings, and Mischiefs
by them performed; and were very credible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
in what they said. Nevertheless, this Evidence
was not produced against the Prisoner at the Bar,
in as much as there was other Evidence enough
to proceed upon.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>3. <i>Benj. Abbot</i> gave in his Testimony, That last
<i>March</i> was a Twelve month, this <i>Carryer</i> was
very angry with him, upon laying out some Land
near her Husbands. Her expressions in this
Anger were, <i>That she would stick as close to</i> Abbot,
<i>as the Bark stuck to the Tree; and that he should
repent of it afore seven Years came to an end, so as
Doctor</i> Prescot <i>should never cure him</i>. These
words were heard by others, besides <i>Abbot</i> himself,
who also heard her say, <i>She would hold his
Nose as close to the Grind-stone as ever it was held
since his name was</i> Abbot. Presently after this he
was taken with a swelling in his Foot, and then
with a Pain in his Side, and exceedingly tormented.
It bred unto a Sore, which was lanced
by Dr. <i>Prescot</i>, and several Gallons of Corruption
ran out of it. For six Weeks it continued
very bad; and then another Sore bred in his
Groin, which was also lanced by Dr. <i>Prescot</i>.
Another Sore bred in his Groin which was likewise
Cut, and put him to very great misery. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>was brought unto Death's door, and so remained
until <i>Carryer</i> was taken and carried away by the
Constable. From which very day he began to
mend, and so grew better every day, and is well
ever since.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p><i>Sarah Abbot</i> also his Wife testified, that her
Husband was not only all this while Afflicted in
his Body; but also that strange, extraordinary and
unaccountable calamities befel his Cattle; their
Death being such as they could guess at no Natural
Reason for.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>4. <i>Allin Toothaker</i> testified, that <i>Richard</i> the
Son of <i>Martha Carryer</i>, having some difference
with him, pull'd him down by the Hair of the
Head, when he rose again, he was going to strike
at <i>Richard Carryer</i>, but fell down flat on his back
to the ground, and had not power to stir Hand
or foot, until he told <i>Carryer</i> he yielded; and
then he saw the shape of <i>Martha Carryer</i>, go off
his Breast.</p>

<p>[138] This <i>Toothaker</i> had received a wound in
the Wars, and he now testified, that <i>Martha Carryer</i>
told him, <i>He shall never be cured</i>. Just
afore the apprehending of <i>Carryer</i>, he could thrust
a Knitting-Needle into his wound four Inches
deep, but presently after her being seized, he was
thoroughly healed.</p>

<p>He further testified, that when <i>Carryer</i> and he
sometimes were at variance, she would clap her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>Hands at him and say, <i>He should get nothing by it</i>.
Whereupon he several times lost his Cattle, by
strange Deaths, whereof no natural causes could
be given.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>5. <i>John Roger</i> also testified, that upon the
threatning words of this malicious <i>Carryer</i>, his
Cattle would be strangely bewitched; as was
more particularly then described.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>6. <i>Samuel Preston</i> testified, that about two Years
ago, having some difference with <i>Martha Carryer</i>,
he lost a Cow in a strange, preternatural, unusual
manner; and about a Month after this, the said
<i>Carryer</i>, having again some difference with him,
she told him, <i>He had lately lost a Cow, and it should
not be long before he lost another!</i> which accordingly
came to pass; for he had a thriving and
well kept Cow, which without any known cause
quickly fell down and died.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>7. <i>Phebe Chandler</i> testified, that about a Fortnight
before the Apprehension of <i>Martha Carryer</i>,
on a Lords Day, while the Psalm was singing
in the Church, this <i>Carryer</i> then took her by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>Shoulder, and shaking her, asked her, <i>Where she
lived?</i> she made her no Answer, altho as <i>Carryer</i>,
who lived next door to her Father's House, could
not in Reason but know who she was. Quickly
after this, as she was at several times crossing the
Fields she heard a Voice that she took to be
<i>Martha Carryers</i>, and it seem'd as if it were over
her head. The Voice told her, <i>She should within
two or three Days be Poison'd</i>: Accordingly within
such a little time, one half of her Right Hand
became greatly swollen and very painful; as also
part of her Face; whereof she can give no Account
how it came. It continued very bad for
some days; and several times since she has had a
great pain in her Breast; and been so seized on
her Legs that she has hardly been able to go.
She added that lately, going well to the House
of God, <i>Richard</i> the Son of <i>Martha Carryer</i>,
look'd very earnestly upon her, and immediately
her Hand which had formerly been Poisoned, as
is abovesaid, began to pain her greatly, and she
had a strange burning at her Stomach; but was
then struck deaf, so that she could not hear any
of the Prayer, or Singing, till the two or three
last words of the Psalm.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>8. One <i>Foster</i>, who confessed her own share in
the Witchcraft, for which the Prisoner stood Indicted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
affirmed, that she had seen the Prisoner at
some of their Witch-meetings, and that it was
this <i>Carryer</i>, who perswaded her to be a Witch.
She confessed that the Devil carried them on
[139] a Pole to a Witch-meeting, but the Pole
broke, and she hanging about <i>Carryer's</i> Neck,
they both fell down, and she then received an
hurt by the fall, whereof she was not at this very
time recovered.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>9. One <i>Lacy</i>, who likewise confessed her share
in this Witchcraft, now testified that she and the
Prisoner, were once bodily present, at a Witch-meeting
in <i>Salem</i>-Village, and that she knew the

the undoing of her and her Children, by enticing
them into the Snare of the Devil.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

in this Witchcraft, now testified that the Prisoner
was at the Witch meeting in <i>Salem</i>-Village, where
they had Bread and Wine administred unto them.</p>

<i>Susanna Shelden</i><a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> in open Court, had her Hands
unaccountably tied together, with a Wheel-band,
so fast, that without cutting, it could not be loosed.
It was done by a Spectre; and the Sufferer affirm'd,
it was the Prisoners.</p>

Carryer</i>, was the person of whom the Confessions
of the Witches and of her own Children, among
the rest, agreed, that the Devil had promised her,
she should be Queen of Hell.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>Thus far the Account given in <i>Wonders of the

as these, in the Tryal of <i>G. B.</i> viz. [<i>They</i> (i. e.)
<i>the Witnesses were enough to fix the character of a

<p>In the Tryal of <i>Bishop</i>, these words, [<i>but there
was no need of them</i>] i. e. of further Testimony.</p>

<p>These Expressions as they manifest, that he
wrote more like an Advocate than an Historian;
so also that those that were his Imployers were
not mistaken in their choice of him for that
work, however he may have mist it in other
things.</p>

<p>As in his owning (in the Tryal of <i>G. B.</i>) That
the <i>Testimony of the bewitched, and confessors was
not enough against the Accused</i>, for it is known that
not only in <i>New-England</i>, such Evidence has been
taken for sufficient, but also in <i>England</i>, as himself
there owns, and will also hold true of <i>Scotland</i>,
&amp;c. they having proceeded upon such Evidence,
to the taking away of the Lives of many,
to assert that this is not enough, is to tell the
World that such Executions were but so many
Bloody Murders; which surely was not his intent
to say.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

have been omitted that could be
tortured by any Construction against
"this rampant Hag," by the Author,
while all that went to clear
her was rejected. Fortunately the
Case is changed, and the whole is
spread before disinterested Inquirers,
or enough upon which to form a
correct Judgment. Mr. Francis
Dane, the second Minister of Andover,
dared to give his Thoughts
upon the Witchcraft Cases. These
he communicated to the Court, and
the Scribe recorded them among
the Evidence. He said he had
lived above forty Years in Andover,
and in his "healthfull Yeares had
been frequent among y<sup>e</sup> Inhabitants
in their Habitations," and never
heard of anything of the Nature of
Witchcraft until the Arrests the last
Summer (1692). If there were
any Suspicions that Martha Carrier
was a Witch, before she was apprehended,
he said he had never heard
of it; and "as for any other Persons,
I had no Suspicion of them,
and had Charity been put on, the
Diuel would not have had such an
Advantage against us, and I beleeve
many innocent Persons have been
accused." This Testimony of an
aged and worthy Gentleman (then
77), well acquainted with all the
Circumstances, and with the Accused,
should accompany that against
"the rampant Hag."</p></div>

to utter some very wrathful
Expressions against the Author. He
says, or rather, his Defenders for
him: "What was done in the

believe, they did in Conscience of
the <i>Oath</i> of God upon them, and
they followed unto the best of their
Understanding, as we are informed,
the Precedents of <i>England</i> and <i>Scotland</i>,
and <i>other Nations</i> on such a
dark and doleful Occasion. When
they found the Matter carried beyond

stopt."&mdash;<i>Some Few Remarks</i>, 6;

<div class="sidenote"><i>Law Enacted, &amp;c.</i></div>

<p>[140] His telling that the Court began to think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>that <i>Burroughs</i> stept aside to put on Invisibility,
is a rendring them so mean Philosophers, and such
weak Christians, as to be fit to be imposed upon
by any silly pretender.</p>

<p>His calling the Evidence against <i>How</i> trivial,
and others against <i>Burroughs</i>, he accounts no part
of his Conviction; and that of lifting a Gun
with one Finger, its being not made use of as
Evidence, renders the whole but the more perplext.
(Not to mention the many mistakes
therein contain'd.)</p>

<p>Yet all this (and more that might have been
hinted at) does not hinder, but that his Account
of the manner of Trials of those for Witchcraft
is as faithfully related as any Tryals of that kind,
that was ever yet made publick; and it may also
be reasonably thought that there was as careful a
Scrutiny, and as unqestion'd Evidences improved,
as had been formerly used in the Tryals of others,
for such crimes in other places.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Tho indeed
a second part might be very useful to set
forth which was the Evidence Convictive in
these Tryals, for it is not supposed, that Romantick
or Ridiculous stories should have any influence,
such as biting a Spectres Finger so that
the Blood flowed out, or such as <i>Shattock's</i> Story
of 12 Years standing, which yet was presently 18
Years or more, and yet a Man of that excellent
Memory, as to be able to recall a small difference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>his Wife had with another Woman when Eighten
Years were past.</p>

<p>As it is not to be supposed that such as these could
Influence any Judge or Jury, so not unkindness
to relations, or God's having given to one Man
more strength than to some others, the over-setting
of Carts, or the death of Cattle, nor yet Excrescencies
(call'd Tets) nor little bits of Rags
tied together (call'd Poppets.) Much less any
persons illness, or having their Cloaths rent when
a Spectre has been well hanged, much less the
burning the Mares Fart, mentioned in the Tryal
of <i>How</i>.</p>

<p>None of these being in the least capable of
proving the Indictment; The supposed Criminals
were Indicted for Afflicting, <i>&amp;c.</i> such and
such particular persons by Witchcraft, to which
none of these Evidences have one word to say,
and the Afflicted and Confessors being declared
not enough, the matter needs yet further explaining.</p>

<p>But to proceed, the General Court having sat
and enacted Laws, particularly one against Witchcraft,
assigning the Penalty of Death to any that
shall feed, reward or employ, <i>&amp;c.</i> Evil Spirits,
though it has not yet been explained what is intended
thereby, or what it is to feed, reward or
imploy Devils, <i>&amp;c.</i> yet some of the Legislators
have given this instead of an Explanation, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
they had therein but Copied the Law of another

<p><i>January</i> 3. By vertue of an Act of the General
Court, the first Superior Court was held at <i>Salem</i>,
for the County of <i>Essex</i>, the Judges appointed
were Mr. <i>William Stoughton</i> (the Lieutenant
Governor) <i>Thomas</i> [141] <i>Danforth</i>, <i>John Richards</i>,
<i>Wait Winthorp</i>, and <i>Samuel Sewall</i>, Esquires.
Where Ignoramus was found upon the several
Bills of Indictment against Thirty, and <i>Billa-Vera</i>
against Twenty six more; of all these
Three only were found Guilty by the Jewry
upon Trial, two of which were (as appears by
their Behaviour) the most senseless and Ignorant
Creatures that could be found; besides which it
does not appear what came in against those more
than against the rest that were acquitted.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>The Third was the Wife of <i>Wardwell</i>, who
was one of the Twenty Executed, and it seems
they had both confessed themselves Guilty; but
he retracting his said Confession, was tried and
Executed; it is supposed that this Woman fearing
her Husbands fate, was not so stiff in her
denials of her former Confession, such as it was.
These Three received Sentence of Death.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

of Samuel Wardwell may
be seen in the Records, in the usual
Form. He was of Andover, and
is styled Carpenter. His first Indictment
was for afflicting one Martha Sprague of Boxford, in
August last (1692). The second
charges, that "about 20 Yeares
agoe, in the Towne of Andivor,
he the said Samuel Wardell, with
the Evill Speritt the Devill [did
felloniously make] a Couenant
wherein he promised to honor,
worship and belieue the Devill
Contrary to the Stattute." His
Examination was before John Higginson,
Esq. on Sept. 1st, 1692.
He was then about 46 Years old.
His strange Answers clearly indicate
a state of Insanity. Martha
Sprague, aged 16, swore to being
bewitched by him. Ephraim Foster
of Andover, aged about 34,
swore that he foretold Events by
looking in people's Hands; "would
cast his Eyes down upon y<sup>e</sup> ground
allways before he told enything."
Thomas Chandler, aged about 65,
often heard said Wardwell tell
young Persons their Fortunes. Joseph
Ballard, aged about 41, swore
that his Brother John Ballard told
him that Samuel Wardwell told
him, that he (Wardwell) had bewitched
his (Joseph Ballard's) Wife.
Abigail Martin of Andover, aged
16, said that some time last Winter
S. Wardwell and John <i>Farnam</i> were
at her Fathers. W. told F.'s Fortune.
He also told Jeams Bridge's
Fortune. See <i>Records S. W.</i> ii,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>

At these Tryals some of the Jewry made Inquiry
of the Court, what Account they ought to
make of the Spectre Evidence? and received for
Answer [as much as of Chips in Wort]<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p><i>January</i> 31, 169⅔. The Superior Court began
at <i>Charlestown</i>, for the County of <i>Middlesex</i>, Mr.
<i>Stoughton</i>, M. <i>Danforth</i>, M. <i>Winthorp</i>, and Mr.
<i>Sewall</i> Judges, where several had Ignoramus returned
upon their Bills of Indictment, and <i>Billa
Vera</i> upon others.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>

In the time the Court sat, word was brought
in, that a Reprieve was sent to <i>Salem</i>, and had
prevented the Execution of Seven of those that
were there Condemned, which so moved the
chief Judge, that he said to this effect, <i>We were
in a way to have cleared the Land of these, &amp;c. who
it is obstructs the course of Justice I know not; the
Lord be merciful to the Countrey</i>, and so went off
the Bench, and came no more that Court:<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> The
most remarkable of the Tryals, was of <i>Sarah
Daston</i>, she was a Woman of about 70 or 80
Years of Age, To usher in her Tryal, a report
went before, that if there were a Witch in the
World she was one, as having been so accounted
of, for 20 or 30 Years; which drew many People
from <i>Boston, &amp;c.</i> to hear her Tryal. There were
a multitude of Witnesses produced against her;
but what Testimony they gave in seemed wholly
forreign, as of accidents, illness, &amp;<i>c.</i> befalling
them, or theirs after some Quarrel; what these
testified was much of it of Actions said to be
done 20 Years before that time. The Spectre-Evidence
was not made use of in these Tryals, so
that the Jewry soon brought her in not Guilty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>her Daughter and Grand-daughter, and the rest
that were then tried, were also acquitted. After
she was cleared Judge <i>Danforth</i> Admonished her
in these words, <i>Woman, Woman, repent, there are
shrewd things come in against you</i>; she was remanded
to Prison for her Fees, and there in a
short time expired.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> One of <i>Boston</i> that had
been at the Tryal of <i>Daston</i>, being the same Evening
in company with one of the Judges [142] in
a publick place, acquainted him that some that
had been both at the Tryals at <i>Salem</i> and at this
at <i>Charlestown</i>, had asserted that there was more
Evidence against the said <i>Daston</i> than against any
at Salem, to which the said Judge conceeded,
saying, <i>That it was so</i>. It was replied by that
person, <i>that he dare give it under his hand, that
there was not enough come in against her to bear a
just reproof</i>.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 25, 1693. The first Superior Court was
held at <i>Boston</i>, for the County of <i>Suffolk</i>, the
Judges were the Lieutenant Governour, Mr. <i>Danforth</i>,
Mr. <i>Richards</i>, and Mr. <i>Sewall</i>, Esquires.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mary Watkins's <i>Tryal</i>.</div>

<p>Where (besides the acquitting Mr. <i>John Aldin</i>
by Proclamation) the most remarkable was, what
related to <i>Mary Watkins</i>, who had been a Servant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>and lived about Seven Miles from <i>Boston</i>, having
formerly Accused her Mistress of Witchcraft, and
was supposed to be distracted, she was threatned
if she persisted in such Accusations to be punished,
this with the necessary care to recover her Health,
had that good effect, that she not only had her
Health restored, but also wholly acquitted her
Mistress of any such Crimes, and continued in
Health till the return of the Year, and then again
falling into Melancholy humours she was found
strangling herself; her Life being hereby prolonged,
she immediately accused herself of being
a Witch; was carried before a Magistrate and
committed. At this Court a Bill of Indictment
was brought to the Grand Jury against her, and
her confession upon her Examination given in as
Evidence, but these not wholly satisfied herewith,
sent for her, who gave such account of herself,
that they (after they had returned into the Court
to ask some Questions) Twelve of them agreed
to find Ignoramus, but the Court was pleased to
send them out again, who again at coming in returned
it as before.</p>

<p>She was continued for some time in Prison,
<i>&amp;c.</i> and at length was sold to <i>Virginia</i>. About
this time the Prisoners in all the Prisons were
released.</p>

<p>To omit here the mentioning of several Wenches
in <i>Boston, &amp;c.</i> who pretended to be Afflicted, and
accused several, the Ministers often visiting them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
and praying with them, concerning whose Affliction
Narratives are in being. In Manuscript not
only these, but the generality of those Accusers
may have since convinced the Ministers by their
vicious courses that they might err in extending
too much Charity to them.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the whole in the <i>Massachusetts</i>
Colony was Sir <i>William Phips</i>, Governour,
being call'd home, before he went he pardon'd
such as had been condemned, for which they gave
about 30 Shillings each to the Kings Attorney.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

[143] had been accused by some Children that
pretented to the Spectral sight; they searched her
several times for Tets; they tried the Experiment
of casting her into the Water, and after this she
was Excommunicated by the Minister of <i>Wallinsford</i>.
Upon her Tryal nothing material appeared
against her, save Spectre Evidence, she was acquitted,
as also her Daughter, a Girl of Twelve
or Thirteen Years old, who had been likewise
Accused; but upon renewed Complaints against
them, they both flew into <i>New-York</i> Government.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

in that God is pleased still to go on in
diminishing our Substance, cutting short our Harvest,

so many both at home and abroad, and that after
many days of publick and Solemn addressing of
him. And altho considering the many Sins prevailing
in the midst of us, we cannot but wonder
at the Patience and Mercy moderating these Rebukes;
yet we cannot but also fear that there is
something still wanting to accompany our Supplications.
And doubtless there are some particular
Sins, which God is Angry with our <i>Israel</i>

us, about which God expects to be sought if ever
he turn again our Captivity.</p>

<p>Wherefore it is Commanded and Appointed,

be observed as a Day of Prayer, with Fasting
throughout this Province, strictly forbidding all
Servile labour thereon; that so all Gods People

all iniquity may be put away which hath stirred
God's Holy jealousie against this Land; that he
would shew us what we know not, and help us
wherein we have done amiss to do so no more;

hand have been fallen into, either by the body of
this People, or any orders of men, referring to
the late Tragedy, raised among us by Satan and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><big><i>Since making the foregoing Collections of
Letters, to the Reverend Mr.</i> Cotton
Mather, <i>and others, &amp;c. (which as yet
remain unanswered) a Book is come to
hand Intituled</i>,</big></p></blockquote>

<p class="dropcap">THE <i>Life of Sir</i> William Phips, <i>printed in</i>
London, 1697. Which Book, tho it bears
not the Authors name, yet the Stile, manner and
matter is such, that were there no other demonstration
or token to know him by, it were no
Witchcraft to determine that the said Mr. <i>C. M.</i>
is the Author of it. But that he that has <i>encountred
Enchantments</i>, and gone through the
<i>Wonders of the Invisible World</i>, and <i>discovered the
Devil</i>, that he should step aside into a Remote
Country to put on Invisibility! Tho the reason
of this be not so manifest, yet it may be thought
to be to gratifie some peculiar fancies; and why
may not this be one, that he might with the
better grace extol the Actions of Mr. <i>Mather</i>, as
Agent in England, or as President of <i>Harvard</i>
College, not forgetting his own.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
</p>
<p>
As to Sir <i>William</i>, it will be generally <i>acknowledged</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
that notwithstanding the meanness of his
Parentage and Education, he attain'd to be Master
of a Ship, and that he had the good hap to
find a <i>Spanish</i> Wreck, not only sufficient to repair
his Fortunes, but to raise him to a considerable
Figure; which King <i>James</i> did so far accommodate
as to make <i>him a Knight</i>.</p>

<p>[146] And that after this, in the Reign of his
Present Majesty, <i>he took up with those of the Agents,
that were for accepting the New Charter, whereby
himself became Governour</i>.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>It is not doubted, but that he aimed at the
good of the People, and great Pitty it is that his
Government was so sullied (for want of better
Information and Advice, from those whose duty
it was to have given it) by that Hobgoblin Monster,
Witchcraft, whereby this Countrey was Night-Mar'd,
and harrast, at such a rate, as is not easily
imagined.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>After which some complaints going to <i>England</i>
about Male-Administration, in the least
matters comparatively; yet were such, that he
was call'd home to give account thereof, where
he soon after expired, so finishing his Life and
Government together.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>

Death having thus drawn the Curtain, forbidding
any further Scene, it might have been prudence,
to let his dust remain without disturbance.</p>

<p>But the said Book endeavouring to raise a
Statue to him (<i>i. e.</i>) to ascribe to him such
Achievements as either were never <span class="err" title="original: peformed">performed</span> by
him, or else unduly aggravated, this has opened
the Mouth, both of Friends and Enemies to
recount the mistakes in the said Book; as also
those miscarriages, wherewith Sir <i>William</i> was
chargeable; such as, had it not been for this
Book, had been buried with him.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>In P. 3, search is made over the World, to
whom to compare him in his Advancement; and
most unhappily <i>Pizarro</i> is pitched upon as a match
for him, who was a Bastard, dropt in a Church-Porch,
put to Suck of a Sow, and being grown,
ran away, and Shipt himself for <i>America</i>; there
so prospered, as to Command an Army; and
therewith did mighty things, particularly took
<i>Attaballipa</i>, one of the Kings of <i>Peru</i> Prisoner,
and having received for his Ransom, in Gold and
Silver to the value of Ten Millions, perfidiously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
put him to Death; and was the Death of no
Man knows how many Thousands of Innocents,
and is certainly one of the worst that could have
been pitched upon for such comparison.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Tho this together with the Rhetorical flourishes,
and affected strains therein, are instances of
the Author's variety of Learning; for which he
is recommended by these Three <i>Venerable</i> Person<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
in the entrance to the said Book. Yet the
<i>Integrity</i>, <i>Prudence</i>, and <i>Veracity</i> thereof, is not
so manifestly to be seen. Passing over a multitude
of Misrepresentations that are therein relating
to the Acts of Sir <i>William</i>, as not designing
to rake in the Grave of the Dead, Who is it
can see the Veracity of those words? P. 40. [He
lay within <i>Pistol-Shot</i> of the Enemies Cannon,
and beat them from thence, and much batter'd
the town, having his Ship shot thro in an hundred
places, with <i>Four and twenty Pounders</i>,]
When in the Judgment of those present, they
were not nearer to the Enemy, than about <i>half
or three quarters of a Mile</i>; that there might be
in all about <i>Seven Shot</i> that [147] struck the
Hull of the Vessel, none of them known to be
bigger than 18 Pounders, the Enemy having but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
one Gun that could carry so big as an 18 pound
Ball.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>It were a fondness after such assertions, to take
any notice of this bedeck'd Statue, when there
was so much the less need of erecting one (as is
asserted P. 108) having already been done so well,
that even this Author himself despairs of doing it
better;<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
and that by one, a Man of such diffused
and Embalm'd a Reputation, <i>as that his Commendations</i>
are asserted to be enough to <i>Immortalize</i> the
Reputation of Sir <i>William</i>, or whomsoever else
<i>he should</i> please to bestow them upon, <i>viz.</i> That
Reverend person <i>who was</i> the President of the
only University then in the <i>English America</i>, P.
109. Which by the way is a much fairer Statue,
in honour of the President of the University, than
that erected for Sir <i>William</i>.</p>

<p>For notwithstanding all this noise of Erecting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
Statues, and the great danger in plucking them
down, <i>&amp;c.</i> yet in P. 89, 'tis said that even Sir
<i>William</i> shewed Choler enough, leaving it open
for others, thereby to understand, that he was
wholly given over to Passion and Choler.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> And
in P. 92, 'tis said he did not affect any mighty
shew of Devotion; these expressions with others
may prevail with the unbiased Reader to think
that these builders of Statues, had some further
design in it, than to blazen the Achievements of
Sir <i>William Phips, viz.</i> To set forth Mr. <i>J.
Mathers</i> Negociation in <i>England</i>, his procuring
the New-Charter for Sir <i>William</i> to be Governour,
and himself Establish'd President of the
College, are the things principally driven at in
the Book.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>Another principal thing is to set forth the supposed
Witchcrafts in <i>New-England</i>, and how well
Mr. <i>Mather</i> the Younger therein acquitted himself.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>

As to the New Charter for the right understanding
that Affair, it will be needful to say, that
the People that afterwards settled in <i>New England</i>,
being about to leave their Native soil, and to seek
(as the Providence of God should direct them)
a settlement in remote Regions, wherein they
might best secure their Civil and Religious Interests,
before they enter'd upon this, considering
it might be needful on many accounts for their
future well being, they obtain'd a Charter to be
in the nature of a prime agreement, setting forth
the Soveraigns Prerogative, and the People's Priviledges;
in the enjoyment whereof they long
continued, after having purchas'd the Title to
their Lands, of the Natives of the Country, and
settled themselves therein, without any charge to
the Crown.</p>

<p>That Clause in their Charter for this Country,
<i>viz.</i> (Provided that no other Christian Prince be
prepossest of it) being a tacit acknowledgment,
that before settlement no one Christian Prince
had any right thereto more than another. During
this time of <i>New-England's</i> Prosperity, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
Government here were very sparing of Granting
Freedoms, except to such as [148] were so and
so qualfied. Whereby the number of
<i>Non</i>-Freemen<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
being much increas'd, they were very uneasie,
by their being shut out from having any share
in the Government, or having any Votes for their
Representatives, <i>&amp;c.</i> it rendred many of them
ready to join with such as were undermining the
Government, not duly considering that it had
been far more safe to have endeavoured to prevail
with the Legislators for an enlargement.</p>

<p>So that it will not be wonder'd at that in the
latter end of the Reign of King <i>Charles</i> the II.
and of King <i>James</i>, (when most of the Charters
in <i>England</i> were vacated) that this was <i>quo warranto'd</i>
and finally Judgment entered up against
it, and the Country was put into such a form of
Government as was most agreeable to those times,
<i>viz.</i> A Legislative pow'r was lodg'd in the
Governour (or President) and some few appointed
to be of his Counsel, without any regard therein,
either to the Laws of <i>England</i>, or those formerly
of this Colony: Thus rendering the Circumstances
of this Country beyond comparison worse
than those of any Corporation in <i>England</i>. The
People of those Corporations being acknowledged
still to have a right to <i>Magna Charta</i>, when their
particular Charters were made void. But here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
when <i>Magna Charta</i> has been pleaded, the People
have been answered, that they must not expect
that <i>Magna Charta</i> would follow them to the
end of the World: not only their Estates, but
their Lives being thereby rendered wholly precarious.
And Judge <i>Palmer</i><a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
has set forth in
Print, that the King has power to grant such a
Commission over this People.</p>

<p>It is not hard to imagine that under such a
Commission, not only the People were liable to
be opprest by Taxes, but also by Confiscations,
and Siezing of Lands, unless Patents were purchased
at Excessive prizes, with many other Exorbitant
Innovations.</p>

<p>The first that accepted this Commission was
Mr. <i>Dudley</i>, a Gentleman born in this Country,
who did but prepare the way for Sir <i>Edm. Andros</i>.
In whose time things being grown to such
Extremities, not only here, but in <i>England</i>, as
render'd the succeeding Revolution absolutely necessary;
the Revolution here being no other than
an acting according to the Precedent given by
<i>England</i>.</p>

<p>During the time of Sir <i>Edmonds'</i> Government,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
Mr. <i>Increase Mather</i>, Teacher of the North
Church in <i>Boston</i>, having undergone some trouble
by Fobb-Actions<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> laid upon him, <i>&amp;c.</i> (tho with
some difficulty) he made his Escape, and got passage
for <i>England</i>, being therein assisted by some
particular Friends; where being arrived, he applied
himself to King <i>James</i> for redress of those
Evils the Country then groaned under; and
meeting with a seeming kind reception, and some
promises, it was as much as might at that time be
reasonably expected.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>[149] Upon the Day of the Revolution here,
tho the greatest part of the People were for reassuming
their Ancient Government, pursuant to
his Royal Highness' Proclamation; yet matters
were so clog'd, that the People were dissmist
without it, who did not in the least mistrust but
that those who were put out of the Government
by Mr. <i>Dudley</i>, would reassume: Mr. <i>Broadstreet</i>,
who had been then Governour, being heard to
say that Evening, when returned home, <i>That had
not he thought they would have reassum'd, he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
not have stirr'd out of his House that Day</i>.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> But
after this, some that were driving at other matters,
had opportunities by Threats and other ways not
only to prevail with that good Old Gentleman,
but with the rest of the Government wholly to
decline it; which some few observing, they took
the opportunity to call themselves a Committee
of Safety, and so undertook to Govern such as
would be govern'd by them.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>It has been an Observation of long continuance
<i>that matters of State seldom prosper, when managed
by the Clergy</i>. Among the opposers of the reassuming
few were so strenuous as some of the
Ministers, and among the Ministers none more
vehement than Mr. <i>Cotton Mather</i>, Pastor of the
<i>North</i> Church in <i>Boston</i>, who has charged them
as they would answer it another day to reassume.
Among his Arguments against it, one was that it
would be to put a slight upon his Father, who,
he said, was in <i>England</i>, labouring for a compleat
Restoration of Charter Privileges, not doubting,
but they would be speedily obtain'd. Any Man
that knows <i>New England</i> cannot but be sensible,
that such Discourses from such Men, have always
been very prevalent. And hence it was that even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
those that would think themselves wronged, if
they were not numbred among the best Friends
to <i>New-England</i>, and to its Charter, would not
so much as stoop to take it up, when there was
really nothing to hinder them from the Enjoyment
thereof.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>After the Committee of Safety had continued
about seven Weeks, or rather after Anarchy had
been so long Triumphant, an Assembly having
been call'd came to this resolve and laid it before
those Gentlemen that had been of the Government,
that if they would not act upon the Foundation
of the Charter, that persuant to it, the
Assembly would appoint some others in that Station.
The Answer to which was, that they would
accept, <i>&amp;c.</i> And when a Declaration signifying
such a reassuming, was prepared with the good
liking of the Deputies, in order to be published,
some that were opposers, so terrified those Gentlemen,
that before publishing it was underwritten
[that they would not have it understood that they
did reassume Charter-Government] to the no
small amazement of the People, and disappointment
of the Deputies, who if these had not
promised so to act, had taken other care, and put
in those that would.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>

[150]
The next principal thing done was, they
chose two of their Members, <i>viz.</i> one of the
upper House, the other of the lower, both of
them Gentlemen of known Integrity, as well as
ability to go to <i>England</i>, in order to obtain their
Resettlement;<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> and in regard Mr. <i>I. Mather</i> was
already there, they joined him, as also a certain
Gentleman in <i>London</i><a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> with these other two:
Those from hence being arrived in <i>London</i>, they
all united for the common Interest of the Countrey,
though without the desired effect. They
were in doubt, whether it were best to Improve
their Utmost for a reversal of the Judgment in a
Course of Law, or to obtain it in a Parliamentary
way, or to Petition his Majesty for a New Grant
of former Priviledges; And considering that the
two first might prove Dilatory and Expensive, as
well as for other reasons, they resolved upon the
latter, and Petition'd his Majesty for the Countries
Resettlement, with former Privileges, and what
further additionals his Majesty in his Princely
Wisdom should think fit. Accordingly it pleased
his Majesty to declare in Counsel his Determination,
<i>viz.</i> That there should be a Charter granted
to <i>New-England</i>. But the Minutes then taken
thereof, and a Draught of the <i>New-Charter</i> being
seen, it was the Opinion of the two Gentlemen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
sent from hence, that it were best to tarry his
Majesties return from <i>Flanders</i>; in hopes then to
obtain ease in such things as might be any ways
deemed to be grievous. And this was the result
of the Advice of such as were best able to give
it, that they could meet with, and accordingly
they wholly desisted taking it out of the Offices.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>But Mr. <i>Mather</i> and that other Gentleman
had, as it is said, other advice given them, which
they strenuously pursued, and his Majesty having
left it as is asserted in this of the Life of Sir
<i>William</i>, P. 57, to them to nominate a Governour,
they pitcht upon Sir <i>William Phips</i>, who
was then in <i>England</i>, [As the most likely and able
to serve the King's Interests among the People
there; under the changes in some things unacceptable
now brought upon them, P. 62.] and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
without tarrying for the concurrence of those
other Agents, the Charter was taken out, <i>&amp;c.</i><a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>But Mr. <i>Mather</i> perhaps fearing he should
have but small thanks here, for his having so far
an hand in bringing upon them those unacceptable
Changes, wrote, and caused to be Printed, an
Account of his Negotiation, but surely by some
Error in the Conception, it proved only an <i>Embrio</i>,
and was stifled as soon as born. One indeed,
designed to be as it were a <i>Posthumous</i> was left
with Mr. <i>Bailey</i>, formerly of <i>Boston</i>, and a Member
of the <i>North-Church</i>, with a charge not to
suffer it to be seen till he were gone to <i>New-England</i>;
yet it seems some other person got a
sight of it, which was the occasion of Mr. <i>Mather</i>'s
sending him that Minatory Epistle, by some
call'd a Bull. But besides this, for fear of the
worst, Mr. <i>Mather</i> got several <i>Non-con</i> Ministers
to give him a Testimonial, or Letters of Commendations
for his great Service herein.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>[151]
In the mean time Mr. <i>Cotton Mather</i>,
being in some doubt of the same thing, handed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
about a Paper of Fables; wherein his Father
under the Name of <i>Mercurius</i>, and himself under
the Name of <i>Orpheus</i>, are extoll'd, and the great
Actions of <i>Mercurius</i> magnified; the present
Charter exalted, by trampling on the former, as
being very defective, and all those call'd unreasonable
that did not readily agree with the New
one: And indeed the whole Country are compared
to no better than Beasts, except <i>Mercurius</i>
and <i>Orpheus</i>, the Governour himself must not
Escape being termed an Elephant, tho as good as
he was great, and the Inferiours told by <i>Orpheus</i>
that for the quiet Enjoyment of their Lands, <i>&amp;c.</i>
they were beholding to <i>Mercurius</i>. Tho this
Paper was judged not convenient to be Printed,
yet some Copies were taken, the Author having
shown variety of <i>Heathen</i> Learning in it.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>This is in short that eminent Service for which
the said Mr. <i>I. M.</i> is in the present Book so
highly extol'd. In so many Pages, that to repeat
them were to transcribe a considerable part of the
said Book.</p>

<p>And no doubt he deserves as much thanks as
Dr. <i>Sharp</i><a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
did, when he was sent by the Presbytery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
of <i>Scotland</i>, to procure the settlement of
their Kirk by King <i>Charles</i> II. at his Restauration.</p>

<p>Not but that the present Charter of <i>New-England</i>
is indeed truly valuable, as containing in it
peculiar Priviledges, which abundantly Engages
this People to pay the tribute of thankfulness to
his Majesty,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> and all due subjection to whom it
shall please him to substitute as Governour over
us; and to pray that the King of Kings would
pour out of his richest blessings upon him, giving
him a long and prosperous Reign over the Nations,
under the benign Influences whereof, Oppression
and Tyranny may flee away.</p>

<p>And if his Majesty hath put this People into
the present form of Government, to the end they
might be in the better condition of Defence in a
time of War; or that they might the better understand
the Priviledge of choosing their own
Governour by the want of it, and should be graciously
pleased (the War being over) to restore to
these, as has been already granted to the rest of
his Majesties Subjects, the full employment of
their Ancient Priviledges, it would be such an
obligation upon them to thankfulness and Duty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
as could never be forgotten, nor sufficiently exprest,
and would rather abate than increase charge
to the Crown.</p>

<p>As to the supposed Witchcrafts in <i>New-England</i>,
having already said so much thereof, there
is the less remains to be added.</p>

<p>In the times of Sir <i>Ed. Andros</i> his Government,
Goody <i>Glover</i>, a despised, crazy, ill-conditioned
old Woman, an <i>Irish Roman</i> Catholick, was tried
for Afflicting <i>Goodwins</i> Children; by the Account
of which Tryal, taken in Short-hand, for the use
of the Jury, it may appear that the ge[152]nerality
of her Answers, were Nonsense, and her behaviour
like that of one distracted. Yet the Drs. finding
her as she had been for many Years, brought
her in <i>Compos Mentis</i>; and setting aside her crazy
Answers to some insnaring questions, the proof
against her was wholly deficient: The Jury
brought her Guilty.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
Mr. <i>Cotton Mather</i> was the most active and
forward of any Minister in the Country in those
matters, taking home one of the Children, and
managing such intreagues with that Child, and
after printing such an Account of the whole, in
his Memorable Providences, as conduced much
to the kindling those Flames, that in Sir <i>Williams</i>
time threatned the devouring this Country.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>King <i>Saul</i> in his destroying the Witches out of
<i>Israel</i>, is thought by many to have exceeded, and
in his Zeal to have slain the <i>Gibeonites</i> wrongfully
under that notion: Yet went after this to a Witch
to know his Fortune. For his wrongful destroying
the <i>Gibeonites</i> (besides the Judgments of
God upon the Land) his Sons were hanged; and
for his going to the Witch, himself was cut off.
Our sir <i>William Phips</i> did not do this, but as appears
by this Book had first his Fortune told him,
(by such as the Author counts no better) and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>though he put it off (to his Pastor, who he new
approved not thereof) as if it were brought to
him in writing, without his seeking, <i>&amp;c.</i> Yet
by his bringing it so far, and safe keeping it so
many Years, it appears he made some Account of
it; for which he gave the Writer, after he had
found the Wreck, as a reward, more than Two
hundred pounds. His telling his Wife (P. 6.)
that he should be a Commander, should have a
Brick-House in <i>Greenlane</i>,<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> <i>&amp;c.</i> might be in
confidence of some such Prediction, and that he
could foretel to him (P. 90.) that he should
be Governour of <i>New-England</i>, was probably
such an one, (the Scriptures not having revealed
it.) Such Predictions would have been
counted at <i>Salem</i>, pregnant proofs of Witchcraft,
and much better than what were against several
that suffered there. But Sir <i>William</i>, when the
Witchcrafts at <i>Salem</i> began (in his Esteem) to
look formidable, that he might Act safely in this
Affair, he asked the Advice of the Ministers in
and near <i>Boston</i>; the whole of their Advice and
Answer is Printed in <i>Cases of Conscience</i>, the last
Pages. But lest the World should be Ignorant
who it was that drew the said Advice, in this
Book of the Life of Sir <i>William Phips</i>, P. 77. are
these words, <i>the Ministers made unto his Excellency
and the Counsel a return, drawn up at their desire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>by Mr. Mather the Younger, as I have been informed</i>.
Mr. <i>C. M.</i> therein intending to beguile
the World, and make them think that another,
and not himself had taken that notice of his
(supposed) good Service done therein, which
otherwise would have been ascribed to those
Ministers in General, though indeed the Advice
then given, looks most like a thing of his Composing,
as carrying both Fire [153] to increase,
and Water to quench the Conflagration.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Particularly
after the Devils Testimony, by the supposed
Afflicted had so prevailed, as to take away
the Life of one, and the Liberty of an Hundred,
and the whole Country set into a most dreadful
consternation, then this Advice is given, ushered
in with thanks for what was already done, and
in conclusion, putting the Government upon a
speedy and vigorous prosecution according to the
Laws of God, and the wholesome Statutes of the
<i>English</i> Nation, so adding Oil, rather than Water
to the Flame; for who so little acquainted with
proceedings of <i>England</i>, as not to know that they
have taken some methods, with those here used
to discover who were Witches. The rest of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>Advice, consisting of cautions and directions, are
inserted in this of the Life of Sir <i>William</i>. So
that if Sir <i>William</i>, looking upon the thanks for
what was past, and Exhortation to proceed, went
on to take away the Lives of Nineteen more,
this is according to the Advice said to be given
him by the Ministers, and if the Devil after
those Executions be affronted, by disbelieving his
testimony, and by clearing and Pardoning all the
rest of the Accused; yet this also is according to
that Advice, but to cast the Scale; the same that
drew this Advice, saith, in <i>Wonders of the Invisible
World, Enchantments Encountered</i>; [that to
have a hand in any thing that may stifle or obstruct
a regular detection of that Witchcraft, is
what we may well with a Holy fear avoid:
Their Majesties good Subjects must not every
day be torn to pieces by horrid Witchcraft, and
those bloody Felons be wholly left unprosecuted;
The Witchcraft is a business that will not be
shamm'd.]<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The Pastor of that Church, of
which Sir <i>William</i> was a Member, being of
this Principle, and thus declaring it, after the
former advice; no wonder tho it cast the Scale
against those Cautions. It is rather a Wonder
that no more Blood was shed, for if that Advice
of his Pastors could still have prevail'd with the
Governour, Witchcraft had not been so shammed
off as it was. Yet now in this Book of the Life
of Sir <i>William</i>, the pardoning the Prisoners when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>Condemn'd, and clearing the Goals, is call'd (P.
82) a Vanquishing the Devil, adding this Conquest
to the rest of the Noble Atchievements of
Sir <i>William</i>, tho Performed not only without,
but directly against his Pastors Advice. But this
is not all, tho this Book pretends to raise a Statue
in Honour of Sir <i>William</i>, yet it appears it was the
least part of the design of the Author to Honour
him, but it was rather to Honour himself, and the
Ministers; It being so unjust to Sir <i>William</i>, as
to give a full Account of the cautions given him,
but designedly hiding from the Reader the Incouragements
and Exhortations to proceed, that
were laid before him (under the name of the
Ministers Advice) in effect, telling the World
that those Executions at <i>Salem</i>, were without,
and against the Advice of the Ministers, exprest
in those Cautions, purposely hiding their giving
thanks for what was already done, and exhorting
to proceed; thereby rendering Sir <i>William</i> of so
sanguin a Complexion, that the Ministers had
such cause to fear his going on with the Tragedy,
tho against their Advice; that they desired the
President to write his <i>Cases of Conscience, &amp;c.</i>
To plead misinformation will not salve here,
however it may seem to palliate other things, but
is a manifest, designed traversty, or misrepresentation
of the Ministers Advice to Sir <i>William</i>, a
hiding the truth, and a wronging the dead, whom
the Author so much pretends to honour; for
which the Acknowledgments ought to be as
Universal as the offence. But tho the Ministers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Advice, or rather Mr. C. <i>Mather's</i> was perfectly
Ambidexter, giving as great or greater Encouragement
to proceed in those dark methods, than
cautions against [154] them; yet many Eminent
persons being accused, there was a necessity of a
stop to be put to it. If it be true what was said
at the Counsel-board in answer to the commendations
of Sir <i>William</i>, for his stopping the proceedings
about Witchcraft, <i>viz.</i> That it was high
time for him to stop it, his own Lady being accused;
if that Assertion were a truth, then <i>New-England</i>
may seem to be more beholden to the
accusers for accusing of her, and thereby necessitating
a stop, than to Sir <i>William</i>, or to the Advice
that was given him by his Pastor.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Mr. <i>C. M.</i> having been very forward to write
Books of Witchcraft, has not been so forward
either to explain or defend the Doctrinal part
thereof, and his belief (which he had a Years
time to compose) he durst not venture so as to be
copied.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Yet in this of the Life of Sir <i>William</i>
he sufficiently testifies his retaining that Heterodox
belief, seeking by frightfull stories of the
sufferings of some, and the refined sight of others,
<i>&amp;c.</i> P. 69 to obtrude upon the World, and confirm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
it in such a belief, as hitherto he either
cannot or will not defend, as if the Blood already
shed thereby were not sufficient.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Mr. <i>I. Mather</i>, in his <i>Cases of Conscience</i>, P. 25,
tells of a Bewitched Eye, and that such can see
more than others. They were certainly bewitched
Eyes that could see as well shut as open, and that
could see what never was, that could see the Prisoners
upon the Afflicted, harming of them, when
those whose Eyes were not bewitched could have
sworn that they did not stir from the Bar. The
Accusers are said to have suffered much by biting,
P. 73. And the prints of just such a set of Teeth,
as those they Accused, had, but such as had not
such bewitch'd Eyes have seen the Accusers bite
themselves, and then complain of the Accused.
It has also been seen when the Accused, instead
of having just such a set of Teeth, has not had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
one in his head.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> They were such bewitched
Eyes that could see the Poisonous Powder
(brought by Spectres P. 70.) And that could see
in the Ashes the print of the Brand, there invisibly
heate to torment the pretended Sufferers with,
<i>&amp;c.</i><a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>These with the rest of such Legends have this
direct tendency, <i>viz.</i> To tell the World that the
Devil is more ready to serve his Votaries, by his
doing for them things above or against the course
of Nature, shewing himself to them, and making
explicit contract with them, <i>&amp;c.</i> than the Divine
Being is to his faithful Servants, and that as he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
willing, so also able to perform their desires.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> The
way whereby these People are believed to arrive
at a power to Afflict their Neighbours, is by a
compact with the Devil, and that they have a
power to <i>Commissionate</i> him to those Evils, P. 72.
However Irrational, or inscriptural such Assertions
are, yet they seem a necessary part of the
<i>Faith</i> of such as maintain the belief of such a
sort of <i>Witches</i>.</p>

<p>As the Scriptures know nothing of a covenanting
or commissioning Witch, so Reason cannot
conceive how Mortals should by their Wickedness
arrive at a power to Commissionate Angels, Fallen
Angels, against their Innocent Neighbours. But
the Scriptures are full in it, and the Instances numerous,
that the Almighty, Divine Being has this
prerogative to make use of what Instrument he
pleaseth, in Afflicting any, and consequently to
commissionate Devils: And tho this word commissioning,
in the Authors former Books, might
be thought to be by inadvertency, yet now after
he hath been caution'd of it, still to persist in it
seems highly Criminal. And therefore in the
name of God, I here charge such belief as guilty
of Sacrilege in the highest Nature, and so much
worse than stealing Church Plate, <i>&amp;c.</i> As it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>a higher Offence to steal any of the glorious Attributes
of the Al[155]mighty, to bestow them
upon Mortals, than it is to steal the Utensils appropriated
to his Service. And whether to ascribe
such power of commissioning Devils to the
worst of Men, be not direct Blasphemy, I leave
to others better able to determine. When the
<i>Pharisees</i> were so wicked as to ascribe to <i>Beelzebub</i>,
the mighty works of Christ (whereby he did
manifestly shew forth his Power and Godhead)
than it was that our Saviour declar'd the Sin
against the Holy Ghost to be unpardonable.</p>

<p>When the Righteous God is contending with
Apostate Sinners, for their departures from him,
by his Judgments, as Plagues, Earthquakes,
Storms and Tempests, Sicknesses and Diseases,
Wars, loss of Cattle, <i>&amp;c.</i> Then not only to ascribe
this to the Devil, but to charge one another
with sending or commissionating those Devils to
these things, is so abominable and so wicked, that
it requires a better Judgment than mine to give
it its just denomination.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>But that Christians so called should not only
charge their fellow Christians therewith, but proceed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
to Trials and Executions; crediting that
Enemy to all Goodness, and Accuser of the
Brethren, rather than believe their Neighbours
in their own Defence; this is so Diabolical a
Wickedness as cannot proceed, but from a Doctrine
of Devils; how far damnable it is let others
discuss. Though such things were acting in this
Country in Sir <i>Williams</i> time, yet P. 65. There
is a Discourse of a Guardian Angel, as then
over-seeing it, which notion, however it may suit
the Faith of <i>Ethnicks</i>, or the fancies of <i>Trithemius</i>;
it is certain that the Omnipresent Being,
stands not in need as Earthly Potentates do, of
governing the World by Vicegerents. And if
Sir <i>William</i> had such an Invisible pattern to imitate,
no wonder though some of his Actions were
unaccountable, especially those relating to Witchcraft:
For if there was in those Actions an Angel
superintending, there is little reason to think it
was <i>Gabriel</i> or the Spirit of <i>Mercury</i>, nor <i>Hanael</i>
the Angel or Spirit of <i>Venus</i>, nor yet <i>Samuel</i>
the Angel or Spirit of <i>Mars</i>; Names feigned
by the said <i>Trithemius</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> It may rather be
thought to be <i>Apollyon</i>, or <i>Abaddon</i>.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But here it will be said, What are there
no Witches? Do's not the Law of God command
that they should be extirpated? Is the
Command vain and Unintelligible? <i>Sol.</i> For any
to say that a Witch is one that makes a compact
with, and Commissions Devils, <i>&amp;c.</i> is indeed to
render the Law of God vain and Unintelligible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
as having provided no way whereby they might
be detected, and proved to be such; And how the
<i>Jews</i> waded thro this difficulty for so many Ages,
without the Supplement of Mr. <i>Perkins</i> and
<i>Bernard</i> thereto, would be very mysterious. But
to him that can read the Scriptures without prejudice
from Education, <i>&amp;c.</i> it will manifestly
appear that the Scripture is full and Intelligible,
both as to the Crime and means to detect the
culpable. He that shall hereafter see any person,
who to confirm People in a false belief, about the
power of Witches and Devils, pretending to a
sign to confirm it; such as knocking off of invisible
Chains with the hand, driving away Devils by
brushing, striking with a Sword or Stick, to wound
a person at a great distance, <i>&amp;c.</i> may (according
to that head of Mr. <i>Gauls</i>, quoted by Mr. <i>C. M.</i>
and so often herein before recited, and so well
proved by Scripture) conclude that he has <i>seen
Witchcraft performed</i>.</p>

<p>[156] If <i>Baalam</i> became a Sorcerer by Sacrifizing
and Praying to the true God against his
visible people; Then he that shall pray that the
afflicted (by their <i>Spectral</i> Sight) may accuse some
other Person (whereby their reputations and lives
may be indangered) such will justly deserve the
Name of a <i>Sorcerer</i>. If any Person pretends to
know more than can be known by humane means,
and professeth at the same time that they have it
from the <i>Black-Man, i. e. the Devil</i>, and shall
from hence give Testimony against the Lives of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
others, they are manifestly such as have a familiar
Spirit; and if any, knowing them to have their
Information from the <i>Black-man</i>, shall be inquisitive
of them for their Testimony against others,
they therein are dealing with such as have a <i>Familiar-Spirit</i>.</p>

<p>And if these shall pretend to <i>see the dead</i> by
their <i>Spectral Sight</i>, and others shall be inquisitive
of them, and receive their Answers what it
is the <i>dead say</i>, and who it is they accuse, both
the one and the other are by Scripture <i>Guilty of
Necromancy</i>.</p>

<p>These are all of them crimes as easily proved as
any whatsoever, and that by such proof as the Law
of God requires, so that it is <i>no Unintelligible Law</i>.</p>

<p>But if the Iniquity of the times be such that
these Criminals not only Escape Indemnified, but
are Incouraged in their wickedness, and made use
of to take away the Lives of others, this is worse
than a making the Law of God <i>Vain</i>, it being a
rendring of it <i>dangerous</i>, against the Lives of Innocents,
and without all hopes of better, so long
as these Bloody Principles remain.</p>

<p>As long as Christians do Esteem the <i>Law of
God to be Imperfect</i>, as not describing that crime
that it requires to be Punish'd by Death.</p>

<p>As long as men suffer themselves to be Poison'd
in their Education, and be grounded in a <i>False-Belief
by the Books of the Heathen</i>.</p>

<p>As long as the <i>Devil</i> shall be believed to have
<i>a Natural Power, to Act above and against a course
of Nature</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>

As long as the <i>Witches</i> shall be believed to have
a Power to <i>Commission him</i>.</p>

<p>As long as the <i>Devil's Testimony</i>, by the pretended
afflicted, shall be received as <i>more valid to
Condemn</i>, than their Plea of <i>Not Guilty</i> to acquit.</p>

<p>As long as the <i>Accused</i> shall have their <i>Lives
and Liberties</i> confirmed and restored to them,
<i>upon their Confessing themselves Guilty</i>.</p>

<p>As long as the <i>Accused</i> shall be forc't to <i>undergo
Hardships and Torments</i> for their not Confessing.</p>

<p>As long as <i>Tets</i> for the <i>Devil to Suck</i> are

<p>As long as the <i>Lord's Prayer</i> shall be profaned,
by being made a Test, who are culpable.</p>

<p>As long as <i>Witchcraft, Sorcery, Familiar Spirits,
and Necromancy</i>, shall be improved to discover
who are <i>Witches</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

this Affair runs thus: "When the
King was pleased to give a positive
Command that the Charter of New
England should be dispatched, it
was not for the Agents to say, It
shall not be so. True it is, that all
the Agents, when they saw what
Minutes would be inserted in the
Charter, were desirous of a Delay,
until the Kings happy Return to
England. And I may without Vanity
say, no Man laboured to have it
so, more than myself. I prayed
Arch-Bishop Tillotson to intercede
with the Queen for this Favour to
us, who at my Request did so.
Moreover, I drew up several Reasons
against that which in the Minutes
of the New Charter is most
grievous to us; which were by Sir
Henry Ashurst, and my self, delivered
to His Majesties Attourney
General, on July 24. 1691, and
which I did also send to my Lord
Sidney, one of His Majesties principal
Secretaries of State, then with

further Proceedings about the Charter
before the Return of the King,
Mr. Mather says he went into the
Country for the Recovery of his
impaired Health, where, before he
had been three Weeks, he was surprised
by being sent for to London,
"with Information that the King
had signified His Royal Pleasure to
the Earl of Nottingham, that there
should be a Procedure with a Charter

of our Author, his Reviewers
say: "With what Face then
can he insinuate that no Thanks are
due to the Instruments of obtaining
such a valuable Charter, and so
many peculiar Priviledges? Surely
he was beside himself, when he
wrote such Things as these."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i>,

<p><a name="Footnote_165_165" id="Footnote_165_165"></a><a href="#FNanchor_165_165"><span class="label">[165]</span></a> The Authors of the <i>Some
Few Remarks</i>, print a Letter from
Mr. John Goodwin, as a triumphant
Vindication of what Dr. Cotton
Mather published respecting the
bewitchment of Goodwin's Children.
The Letter is too long and
too unimportant to occupy Space
here. It may be seen on Pages 62
and 63 of that Work. It is, of
course, an attempt to sustain Dr.
Mather's Account, the substance of
which Account is in the <i>Magnalia</i>.
They then go on: "Now behold
how active and forward Mr. Mather
was, in transacting the Affairs
relating to this Woman; and be
astonished, that ever any <i>One</i> should
go to insinuate things to the World,
as are known by most that ever
heard of those afflicted Children,
to be so far different from <i>Truth</i>,
as to do what in you lies to lessen
the Esteem of those Servants of
Christ, (which you make your
chiefest <i>Butts</i>) among the Lord's
People.... We pray God <i>Pardon</i>
your Sin, and give you the
Grace to Repent."&mdash;<i>Ibid</i>, 65. See
also <i>Magnalia</i>, B. ii, 61; where it
appears that Mr. Joseph Dudley
was Chief Judge when the poor
old crazy Woman was tried and
Executed.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_166_166" id="Footnote_166_166"></a><a href="#FNanchor_166_166"><span class="label">[166]</span></a> Dr. Mather answers: "After
the Storm was raised at Salem,
I did myself offer to provide Meat,
Drink, and Lodging, for no less
than <i>Six</i> of the Afflicted, that so an
Experiment might be made, whether
<i>Prayer</i> with <i>Fasting</i>, upon the Removal
of those Miserables, one from
another, might not put a Period unto
the Trouble then arising, without giving
the Civil Authority the Trouble
of Prosecuting the Methods of the
Law on that Occasion. You'll say,
How came it then to pass that many
People took up another Notion of
me? Truly, <i>Satan knows</i>. Perhaps
'twas because I thought it my
Duty alwayes to speak of the Honourable
Judges with as much Honour
as I could; (a Crime which I
am generally taxed for, and <i>for which
I have been finely requited</i>!) This
made People, who judge of Things
<i>at a Distance</i>, to dream that I <i>approved</i>
of all that was done."&mdash;<i>Ibid</i>,
39-40. Certainly, if Words
mean any thing, what he published
fully justifies that Conclusion, notwithstanding
his rare <i>Ambidexterity</i>.
See Vol. I, <i>Ubique loci</i>.</p></div>

"Moreover, when the Ministers
presented unto the Governour and
Council, their Advice against making
the <i>Spectral Exhibitions</i> to be
so much as a <i>Presumption of Witchcraft</i>,
it was <i>my</i> poor Hand which
drew up that Advice, and my Heart
was always in it."&mdash;<i>Some Few Remarks</i>,
38-9. But the Doctor does
not explain how, in speaking of this
<i>Address</i> in the Life of Phips, he
came to make use of the Words&mdash;<i>as
I have been informed</i>&mdash;while in
the <i>Some Few Remarks</i> he owns
that it was drawn by his <i>poor Hand</i>.

out, as will be seen on referring to
the Life of Phips, as directed above,
or to the same in the <i>Magnalia</i>, B.
ii, 60, <i>et seq.</i>; one Extract here
must suffice: "But of all the <i>Preternatural</i>
things which befel these
People, there were none more unaccountable
than those, wherein the
prestigious <i>Dæmons</i> would ever now
and then cover the most <i>Corporeal</i>
Things in the World with a <i>Fascinating
Mist</i> of Invisibility. As
now; a Person was cruelly assaulted
by a <i>Spectre</i>, that, she said, run at
her with a <i>Spindle</i>, though no Body
else in the Room could see either
the <i>Spectre</i> or the <i>Spindle</i>: At last, in
her Agonies, giving a Snatch at the
<i>Spectre</i>, she pulled the <i>Spindle</i> away;
and it was no sooner got into her
Hand, but the other Folks then
present beheld that it was indeed a
Real, Proper, Iron <i>Spindle</i>; which,
when they locked up very safe, it
was nevertheless by the <i>Dæmons</i>
taken away to do farther Mischief."
In the <i>Wonders of the Invisible
World</i> (Vol. I, 205), this Story of
the Spindle will be seen among the
<i>Curiosities</i> and is given, as the Author
there tells the Reader, as "a
Bone to pick" for the <i>Dogmatical</i>.

<p><a name="Footnote_173_173" id="Footnote_173_173"></a><a href="#FNanchor_173_173"><span class="label">[173]</span></a> It is highly interesting to hear
the Doctor's Account of this: "It
was also found, that the Flesh of the
Afflicted was often <i>Bitten</i> at such a
Rate, that not only the <i>Print of
Teeth</i> would be left on their <i>Flesh</i>,
but the very <i>Slaver</i> of <i>Spittle</i> too:
As there would appear just such a
<i>set of Teeth</i> as was in the <i>Accused</i>,
even such as might be clearly distinguished
from other People's. And
usually the <i>Afflicted</i> went through a
terrible Deal of seeming Difficulties
from the tormenting <i>Spectres</i>, and
must be long waited on before they
could get a Breathing Space from
their Tormentors to give in their
Testimonies."&mdash;<i>Life of Phips, in
Magnalia</i>, B. ii, 61-2.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_174_174" id="Footnote_174_174"></a><a href="#FNanchor_174_174"><span class="label">[174]</span></a> The Doctor must once again
be heard, otherwise the Reader can
have but a faint Idea of what our
Author is exposing: "The Miserable
exclaimed extreamly of <i>Branding
Irons</i> heating at the Fire on the
Hearth to mark them; now, though
the Standers by could see no <i>Irons</i>,
yet they could see distinctly the
Print of them in the Ashes, and
<i>smell</i> them too as they were carried
by the <i>not-seen Furies</i>, unto the
poor Creatures for whom they were
intended; and those poor Creatures
were thereupon <i>Stigmatized</i> with
them, that they will bear the Marks
of them to their Dying Day. Nor
are these the <i>Tenth Part</i> of the
<i>Prodigies</i> that fell out among the
Inhabitants of New England."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i>,
Page 61. If any one, after
reading these strongly expressed Opinions
of the learned Doctor, will
entertain Doubts, as to his extreme
Credulity and Faith in Witchcraft,
it is not likely to be in human
Power to remove them.</p></div>

Sadducee, Infidel, Liar, Slanderer,"
&amp;c., &amp;c., could not then, nor at
any other Time, alter the Facts so
truly and so succinctly stated here.
Against the above is found: "He
insinuates, that our Reverend Ministers
make the Devil an <i>Independent
Being</i>, and (as he says) <i>consequently
a God</i>. An abominable Charge!"&mdash;<i>Some
Few Remarks</i>, 8, 9. See,

<p><a name="Footnote_176_176" id="Footnote_176_176"></a><a href="#FNanchor_176_176"><span class="label">[176]</span></a> And yet, as inconsistent with
Reason as this absurd Stuff is, it
was the generally prevailing Belief,
and is thus <i>defended</i> in the <i>Some Few
Remarks</i>, P. 8: "The whole Body
of the Ministers in the Country
are charged, as Guilty of Sacriledge
in the highest Degree, if not direct
Blasphemy, and Diabolical Wickedness."
It will at once be seen
that this is as unjust a Charge as
Malignity in its Blindness could invent.

<span class="hide">W</span>HY this Examination was not given by Dr.
Mather, in his Account of the Witchcraft,
cannot be certainly stated; while it may be
conjectured that it was omitted for one of the two
following Reasons: 1st, it may have been thought
not sufficiently damning to the Accused; or, 2dly, it
may have been rejected, as a great Part of the Proceedings
was, for want of Room. It seems not now
to be among the Copies of those Proceedings recently
made, or Mr. Woodward would not have omitted it
in his Work. It is given here, as transcribed by Mr.
David Pulsifer, for the Edition of the <i>More Wonders</i>,
&amp;c., published in Salem by Cushing &amp; Appleton, in
1823. The previous Edition, of course, does not

<p class="hang p2">The Examination of Giles Cory, at a Court at Salem
Village, held by John Hathorn and Jonathan Curwin,
Esqrs., April 19, 1692.</p>

<p>Giles Cory, you are brought before Authority upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>high Suspicion of sundry Acts of Witchcraft. Now
tell us the Truth in this Matter.</p>

<p>I hope, through the Goodness of God, I shall; for
that Matter I never had no Hand in, in my Life.</p>

<p>Which of you have seen this Man hurt you?</p>

<p>Mary Wolcott, Mercy Lewis, Ann Putman, Jr.,
and Abigail Williams affirmed he had hurt them.</p>

<p>Hath he hurt you too? speaking to Elizabeth
Hubbard. She going to answer was prevented by a Fit.</p>

<p>Benjamin Gold, Hath he hurt you?</p>

<p>I have seen him several Times, and been hurt after
it, but cannot affirm that it was he.</p>

<p>Hath he brought the Book to any of you?</p>

<p>Mary Wolcott and Abigail Williams and others
affirmed he had brought the Book to them.</p>

<p>Giles Cory, they accuse you, or your Appearance,
of hurting them, and bringing the Book to them.
What do you say? Why do you hurt them? Tell
us the Truth.</p>

<p>I never did hurt them.</p>

<p>It is your Appearance hurts them, they charge you;
tell us. What have you done?</p>

<p>I have done nothing to damage them.</p>

<p>Have you never entered into Contract with the
Devil?</p>

<p>I never did.</p>

<p>What Temptations have you had?</p>

<p>I never had Temptations in my Life.</p>

<p>What! have you done it without Temptations?</p>

<p>What was the Reason (said Good wife Bibber) that
you were frighted in the Cow-house? And then the
Questionist was suddenly seized with a violent Fit.</p>

<p>Samuel Braybrook, Goodman Bibber, and his
Daughter, testified that he had told them this Morning
that he was frighted in the Cow-house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>

Cory denied it.</p>

<p>This was not your Appearance but your Person,
and you told them so this Morning. Why do you
deny it?</p>

<p>What did you see me in the Cow-house?</p>

<p>I never saw nothing but my Cattle.</p>

<p>Divers witnessed that he told them he was frighted.</p>

<p>Well, what do you say to these Witnesses?</p>

<p>What was it frighted you?</p>

<p>I do not know that ever I spoke the Word in my
Life.</p>

<p>Tell the Truth. What was it frighted you?</p>

<p>I do not know any Thing that frighted me.</p>

<p>All the Afflicted were seized now with Fits, and
troubled with Pinches. Then the Court ordered his
Hands to be tied.</p>

<p>What! Is it not enough to act Witchcraft at other
Times, but must you do it now in Face of Authority?</p>

<p>I am a poor Creature and cannot help it.</p>

<p>Upon the Motion of his Head again, they had
their Heads and Necks afflicted.</p>

<p>Why do you tell such wicked Lies against Witnesses,
that heard you speak after this Manner, this very
Morning?</p>

<p>I never saw anything but a black Hog.</p>

<p>You said that you were stopped once in Prayer;
what stopt you?</p>

<p>I cannot tell. My Wife came towards me and
found Fault with me for saying living to God and
dying to Sin.</p>

<p>What was it frighted you in the Barn?</p>

<p>I know nothing frighted me there.</p>

<p>Why there are three Witnesses that heard you say
so to-day.</p>

<p>I do not remember it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>

Thomas Gold testified that he heard him say, that
he knew enough against his Wife, that would do her
Business.</p>

<p>What was that you knew against your Wife?</p>

<p>Why, that of living to God, and dying to Sin.</p>

<p>The Marshal and Bibber's Daughter confirmed the
same; that he said he could say that that would do
his Wife's Business.</p>

<p>I have said what I can say to that.</p>

<p>What was that about your Ox?</p>

<p>I thought he was hipt.</p>

<p>What Ointment was that your Wife had when she
was seized? You said it was Ointment she made by
Major Gidney's Direction.</p>

<p>He denied it, and said she had it of Goody Bibber,
or from her Direction.</p>

<p>Goody Bibber said it is not like that Ointment.</p>

<p>You said you knew upon your own Knowledge,
that she had it of Major Gidney.</p>

<p>He denied it.</p>

<p>Did you not say, when you went to the Ferry with
your Wife, you would not go over to Boston now, for
you should come yourself next Week?</p>

<p>I would not go over because I had not Money.</p>

<p>The Marshal testified he said as before.</p>

<p>One of his Hands was let go, and several were afflicted.
He held his Head on one Side, and then the
Heads of several of the Afflicted were held on one
Side. He drew in his Cheeks, and the Cheeks of
some of the Afflicted were suckt in.</p>

<p>John Bibber and his Wife gave in Testimony concerning
some Temptations he had to make away with
himself.</p>

<p>How doth this agree with what you said, that you
had no Temptations?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
I meant Temptations to Witchcraft.</p>

<p>If you can give way to self-murther, that will make
way to Temptation to Witchcraft.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;There was Witness by several, that he said
he would make away with himself, and charge his
Death upon his Son.</p>

<p>Goody Bibber testified that the said Cory called
said Bibber's Husband, Damned Devilish Rogue.</p>

<p>Other vile Expressions testified [to] in open Court
by several others.</p>

<p>Salem Village, April 19, 1692. Mr. Samuel Paris
being desired to take in Writing the Examination of
Giles Cory, delivered it in; and upon hearing the
same, and seeing what we did see at the Time of his
Examination, together with the Charge of the afflicted
Persons against him, we committed him to their Majesties
Gaol.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<h3>NUMBER II.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THE following Ballad, in the Chevy Chase Style,
was cut from a Newspaper sixteen years ago.
No one at this Day will probably require to be informed
who was the Author of it, as but <i>one</i> Person
probably <i>could</i> have written it. I have not looked
over the Poems of Mr. Whittier to see if it be there.
Any one having an inclination may do so. The Introduction
accompanied it, on its first appearance:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>

The following Ballad is handed in for Preservation
as illustrative of that dark Period in our local History.
Giles Corey and his Wife lived in what is now Danvers,
and the Spot is now pointed out on the Estate of
Hon. Daniel P. King where their House formerly stood.
The Localities are fast fading out from Remembrance,
and I venture the Suggestion that it may be in the
Province of the Historical Department of our Essex
Institute to mark them by some permanent Monumental
Erection.&mdash;<i>Salem Observer.</i></p>

<h4><big><i>Testimony of William Beale, of Marblehead,
against Mr. Philip English of
Salem, Given August</i> 2<i>d</i>, 1692. Taken
from the Original.</big></h4>

<p class="dropcap">AS Philip English was a Man of a large Estate for
those Days, and carried on an extensive Business,
it may be thought singular that Mr. Calef should
make no Mention of his Case in his Work. It may
be that he had not sufficient Data for the Purpose;
or, more probably, it may have been, that for certain
Reasons he chose to leave the Matter in the Hands
of the two Ministers of the Old South, who, or one
of whom, had not the Independence to work openly
with Mr. Calef, but who, clandestinely, took the Part
of the Accused, and helped him to escape. However
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
this may have been, so far as Mr. Willard was concerned,
enough will have been seen in Mr. Calef's
Work to cause an Agitation of the Question. And
yet, it will appear, from what is to follow, that Mr.
Moody (then with Mr. Willard in the Old South)
was the principal Instrument in the Protection and
final Escape of Mr. English and his Wife from the
Jaws of a "blind Ferocity."</p>

<p>The Testimony of William Beale, which follows
was probably contrived by certain Parties to recover
Property owned or claimed by Mr. English. At the
Time of his Arrest, he owned a Ship of 170 Tons,
named the Porcupine, which was commanded by
Robert Bartel, whose Son, William Bartel, was living
in 1739, at the Age of 45.</p>

<p>Mr. English, it is said, was an Episcopalian. Whether
his Sentiments had anything to do with his being
proceeded against, does not appear. He stated that
by the Prosecution he was damaged £1,500. A Petition
of his to the Committee appointed by the General
Court to compensate Sufferers may be seen in Mr.
Woodward's <i>Collections</i>, ii, 233. It is curious to see
now the Awards made to the Survivors of those
whose Mothers and Fathers had been judicially murdered!
A few Pounds seems to have settled the Account.</p>

<p>What follows, previous to William Beale's Testimony,
although once printed, will be quite new, probably,
to the Majority of Readers; and it is due to
the Memory of a persecuted Family to perpetuate it
in Connection with the wicked Attempt at their Ruin.</p>

<p>About the Year 1810, the Rev. Timothy Alden
was engaged in preparing a Catalogue of Books for
the Massachusetts Historical Society. While in this
Employment he procured from the Rev. William
Bentley, D.D., of Salem, the ensuing Account of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
Mr. English. What led to this Result was Mr. Alden's
Endeavors to obtain Information concerning a
Portsmouth Gentleman. Mr. Alden was then much
interested in Portsmouth Affairs. Dr. Bently proceeds:
"In the Times of the Witchcraft in Salem
Village, no Person distinguished for Property, and
known in the commercial World, was accused but
Philip English.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> He came young into America, from
the Island of Jersey, lived in the Family of Mr. Hollingworth,
a rich Inhabitant of Salem, and afterwards
married his only Daughter and Child, Susanna. The
Wife had received a better Education than is common
even at this Day [1809], as Proofs I hold sufficiently
discover.</p>

<p>From some Prejudices, as early as April 21st,
1692, she was accused of Witchcraft, examined, and
committed to Prison in Salem. Her Firmness is
memorable. Six Weeks she was confined; but, being
visited by a fond Husband, her Husband was also
accused, and confined in the same Prison. By the
Intercession of Friends, and by a Plea that the Prison
was crowded, they were removed to Arnold's Jail in
Boston, till the Time of Trial.</p>

<p>In Boston, upon giving Bail, they had the Liberty
of the Town, only lodging in Prison. Upon their
Arrival, Messrs. Willard and Moodey visited them,
and discovered every Disposition to console them in
their Distress. On the Day before they were to return
to Salem for Trial, Mr. Moodey waited upon
them in the Prison, and invited them to publick
Worship. On the Occasion he chose for the Text,
<span class="smcap">If they persecute you in one City, flee to another.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
In the Discourse, with a manly Freedom, he
justified every Attempt to escape from the Forms of
Justice, when Justice was violated in them. After
Service Mr. Moodey visited the Prisoners in the Gaol,
and asked Mr. English whether he took Notice of his
Discourse? Mr. English said he did not know whether
he had applied it as he ought, and wished some
Conversation upon the Subject. Mr. Moodey then
frankly told him that his Life was in Danger, and he
ought by all means to provide for an Escape. Many,
said he, have suffered. Mr. English then replied,
God will not suffer them to hurt me. Upon this,
Mrs. English said to her Husband, Do you not
think that they, who have suffered already, are innocent?
He said, Yes. Why then may not we suffer
also? Take Mr. Moody's Advice. Mr. Moody
then told Mr. English, that, if he would not carry
his Wife away, he would. He then informed him,
that he had persuaded several worthy Persons in
Boston, to make Provision for their Conveyance out
of the Colony; and, that a Conveyance had been
obtained, encouraged by the Governour, Gaoler, &amp;c.,
which would come at Midnight, and that proper Recommendations
had been obtained to Gov. Fletcher
of New-York; so that he might give himself no concern
about any one Circumstance of the Journey;
that all Things were amply provided. The Governour
also gave Letters to Gov. Fletcher, and, at the
Time appointed, Mr. English, his Wife, and Daughter
were taken and conveyed to New York. He found
that, before his Arrival, Mr. Moodey had dispatched
Letters, and the Governour, with many private Gentlemen
came out to meet him; and the Governour
entertained him at his own House, and paid him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
every Attention, while he remained in the City. On
the next Year he returned.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>In all this Business, Mr. Moody openly justified
Mr. English, and, in defiance of all the Prejudices
which prevailed, expressed his Abhorrence of the
Measures which had obliged a useful Citizen to flee
from the Executioners. Mr. Moodey was commended
by all discerning Men; but he felt the angry Resentment
of the deluded Multitude of his own Times;
among whom, some of high Rank were included. He
soon after left Boston and returned to Portsmouth.</p>

<p>Mrs. English died in 1694, at 42 Years of Age,
in Consequence of the ungenerous Treatment she had
received. Her Husband died at 84 Years of Age, in
1734.</p>

<p>This is the Substance of Communications made
to me at different Times from Madam Susanna Hathorne,
his great-grand-Daughter, who died in Salem,
28 August, 1802, at the Age of 80 Years, who received
the Account from the Descendants of Mr.
English, who dwelt upon his Obligations to Mr.
Moodey with great Pleasure."</p>

<p class="p2">William Beale<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> of Marbllee Head, aged upward of
Sixty Yeares, testifieth and saith, that last March past
was twelve Moenth, towards the latter end of the
Moenth; then myself beeinge in the House of George
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>Bonfeilds, of Marbllee Head, whither I repaired, that
I might haue helpe to nurse, or Looke after mee, because
of a very greate and wracking Paine had seized
upp on my Body, and the Distemper of the Small Pox
then beeing in my House, and my Son Jamis at the
same Time then in my House, lying sick; then towards
the latter End of that Moenth, Aforesayed, in
that House, as I lay in my Bed, in the Morneinge,
presently after it was faiere light abroade in the Roome
where I lay in my Bed, which was layed lowe and
neere unto the Fire, towards the norward part of the
Roome; I beeing broade Awake, I then saw upon the
south Iaume [Jamb] of that Chimny, A darke Shade
which couered the Iaume of that Chimney aforesayed,
from the under Floore to the upper Flloore, and alsoe
A dar[k]ness more then it was beefore, in the southerne
Part of the House, and alsoe in the Middllee of the
Darkness, in the Shade uppon the Iaume of the Chimny
aforesayed, I beeheld somethinge of the Forme or
Shape of A Man. I tooke most notice of his Legs, because
they weere of A very greate Statute, or Bigness.
I wondred at the Sighte, and therefore I turned my
Head as I lay in my Bed, and cast my Eyes towards the
south Side of the House, to see if the Sun weere risen, or
whether there weere any Person or anythinge in the
House, which by the help of the Sun might cause such
A Shade or Shape, but I saw non, nor any Lighte of
the Sun in that Room then. I then turned my Head
uppon the Pillow, where it was before, I saw in the
darkness aforesayed the plaine Shape or els the Person
of Phillip English of Salem, the which, Reports say,
married with William Hollingworths<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Daughter of

and Understandinge of him, as I had formerly Knoledg
and Ackyuaintance with him, my Coniecktures of him
and these Passages aforesayed were as followeth: what is
this Mans buisness heere now? I remember not that
euer I bought or sold with him, either more or less,
or which way came hee hither, so soone this Morneinge,
by Land or by Water; or hath he been at Marbllee
Head all Nighte? And then laboreing to correckt my
[Thoughts] not to thinke that hee was A Wich, and
flyinge to our Omnipotent Jehouah for his Blessing
and Protecktion, by secret Eiaculations, instantly the
Roome, aforesayed, became cleare, and the Shape,
Shade, or Person vanished; and this was about the
Time News was brought to mee in the Morning, that
my Son James was very like to recover of the Small Pox,
which I left at Home sick; and the same Day, in the
After noone, came News that hee was suddenly strooke
with A Paine on his Side, and did not expect to liue
three Houres; and according to my Iudgment, before
three Houres weere ended, Newes came that he was
departed this Life, at which Docktor Iackson, which
was his Docktor, and William Dagget, which was his
Nurse, both of Marbllee Head, told mee that they Admired
and Wondred; and it was not many Moenths
before, that my Son George Beale, departed this Life in
the same House, and complained of A stoping in his

<p class="p2">Far[ther] this Deponent testifieth that in the Springe
of the Yeare before the New England Forces went for
Cannady, Phillip English aforesayed, came into a
Neighbors House where this Deponent then was present,
and then in a fawning and flattering Manner,
sayed to me: You are him which can give mee A good
Evidence in shewing mee the Bounds of my Land.
This Deponent replyed, and sayed, I know not of any
you have; Phillip English replyed yes you doe, and
If you will I[le pay] you well. I have a Peice of
eighte in my Pocket for you, and named A Peice of
Land ly[ing] a certaine Distance from my House,
which I think Mr. Richard Reede<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> of Marblle [Head]
was then and is now in Possession of it; this Deponent
replyed, doe not tell mee of your Peice of eight, for
If I bee called, I must give Evidence against you, and
told him what I must say; at which hee seemed to
bee moued, and told me that I lyed, with more Discourse
aboute [it,] and so then wee departed. Then the
next [Feb?] ensuing, which was about the Time that
the Forces began to com from Cannady, I then haueing
heard that Phillip English aforesayd, had arrested Mr.
Reade aforesayde, about the Land aforesayde, I then,
as I thought it my Duty in Concience, ackquainted
Mr. Reeds Son with what I could say concerninge the
Titllee of the Lande aforesayed, and withall told him of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>Witness, as namely Thomas Farrar Senr,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> of Linn;
then afterward uppon their Request I rode to Lin and
at Lin Mill there I found Thomas Farare, aforesayed,
and as wee rode alonge Lin Commons there
beetwixt the Reuerende Mr. Sheapards House and
Mr. Leytons, then beinge in discourse aboute the
Titllee of the Lande aforesayed, my Nose gushed out
bleedeinge in a most extrordinary manner; so that I
bllodyed a Hankershiff of an considerablle biggness,
and allsoe ran downe uppon my Cloaths and uppon
my Horse Mane. I lighted of my Hors thinking the
iodginge [jogging] of my Horse mighte cause it; but
it kept on, Allthough not alltog[eth]er so bad, till I
came to Mr. Reades at Marbllee head, and it hath

<h3>NUMBER IV.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">ON a first and cursory Perusal of the Examination
of the Indian Woman belonging to Mr. Parris's
Family, it was concluded not to Print it, and
only refer to it; that is, only refer to the Extract from it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>contained in the <span class="smcap">History and Antiquities of Boston</span>.
But when the Editorial labor upon these Volumes
was nearly completed, a reperusal of that Examination
was made, and the result determined the
Editor to give it a place in this Appendix. His
opinion of it, and of those who procured it of the
simple Indian, has been expressed in a previous Page.</p>

<p>The Examination is valuable on several accounts,
the Chief of which is the Light it throws on the Commencement
of the Delusion. It does not appear that
either Dr. Mather or Mr. Calef ever saw it, or their
Accounts of the Beginning of the Transactions would
have been more explicitly stated. The Original (now
for the first time Printed,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>) came into the Editor's
Hands some five and twenty Year's since. It is more
extensive than any of the Examinations yet brought
to light. This is accounted for by its being the First
of that cruel and senseless Series of illegal Proceedings
which ended in so much Agony, Distress, Wretchedness
and Blood.</p>

<p>This Examination, more, perhaps, than any of the
rest, exhibits the atrocious Method employed by the
Examinant of causing the poor, ignorant Accused to
own and acknowledge Things put into their Mouths
by a manner of questioning as much to be condemned
as Perjury itself; inasmuch as it was sure to produce
that Crime. In this Case the Examined was taken
from Jail and placed upon the Stand, and was soon so
confused that she could scarcely know what to say;
while it is evident that all of her Answers were at first
true, because direct, straightforward, and reasonable.
The Strangeness of the Questions and the long Persistence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
of the Questioners could lead to no other
result but the confounding of what little Understanding
the Accused was at best possessed of. Hence this
Record of incoherent Nonsense here submitted; and
of the same tenor was nearly all the Evidence used,
which took away the Lives of numbers of innocent
People.</p>

<p>The Examination was before Messrs. Hathorne and
Corwin. The Former took down the result, which is
all in his peculiar Chirography. The first Proceeding
printed in Mr. Woodward's Collection, having relation
to the Witchcraft affair, is a Warrant for the
Apprehension of Sarah Good, and is dated Feb. 29th,
169½.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
On the next Day, March 1st, the Constable,
George Locker, made Return, that he had brought
the said "Saragh Good," &amp;c. Whether she were present
at Tituba's Examination, does not appear; while
the Documents show that the Apprehension of Sarah
Good, and the Examination of Tituba were on the
same Day.</p>

<p class="p2">Tittube the Indian Woman Examined, March. 1. 169½.</p>

<p class="dropcap">THE Accused, Mary Clark, being called, it was
enquired of Mary Walcot, if ever Clark had
afflicted her? She answered Yes, that is the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>woman. And, upon Mary Clarks looking upon Walcott,
and others of the afflicted, they were struck into
Fitts.</p>

<p>The Justices having used severall Arguments (for
the Good of her Soul) to confess, if she knew herself
guilty. She absolutely denyed. And then the Constable<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
of Haverhill was called; and being asked of
what Fame and Reputation Mary Clark was off? He
answered they had heard she was or had been guilty of
such Things, but, as to any Thing in Particular, he
could not say. The Justices asked Mary Walcot if
she were not mistaken in this Woman? Walcot answered,
This is the very Woman I saw afflict Timothy
Swan,<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> and she has afflicted me several Times.
And after a Fitt she was then immediately in, she said
she saw the above Mary Clark afflict Betty Hubbard,
and Ann Putnam.</p>

<p>The said Mary Clark looking upon Walcott, Hubbard,
Putnam, Warrin, they were in Fitts.</p>

<p>Mary Walcott haveing a Pinn runn into her Arme
suddenly, said that Mary Clark did it.</p>

<p>At the same Tyme Mary Warrin had a Pinn run
into her Throat, under her Chin, which Mr. Noice
took out.</p>

<p>Susanna Sheldon, upon said Examination, had four
Pinns taken out of her Hand; saying that said Clark
put in two of them, and Mr. Usher<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> the other two.</p>

<p>Betty Hubbard<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> was struck down, by her looking

<p>It was asked, if she could say the Lords Prayer,

<p>She erred much.</p>

<p>Ann Putnam said that said Clark had afflicted her
by pinching, choakeing, and striking her in the Face,
and told her, that her Name was Mistriss Mary Clark,

<p>Ann Putnam said further, that she saw the said

she called it a <i>ragged</i> Speare, she said because it was
ragged like a File.</p>

<h4><big><i>An Account of the Life and Character of
the Rev. Samuel Parris, of Salem Village,
and of his Connection with the
Witchcraft Delusion of</i> 1692.</big></h4>

<p class="center">BY SAMUEL P. FOWLER, ESQUIRE.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p class="dropcap">MR. Parris, whose History is so intimately connected
with the Salem Witchcraft Delusion of
1692, was a Son of Thomas Parris of London, and
was born in 1653. He was a Member of Harvard
College, but did not graduate at that Institution. He
was at first a Merchant in Boston, but not succeeding
in Business he left it, and offered himself as a Candidate
for the Ministry.</p>

<p>The People at Salem Village being without a Pastor,
on the 15th of November, 1688, sent a Committee,
consisting of three Persons, viz: Captain John Putnam,
Mr. Joshua Rea, Sen., and Francis Nurse, "to
treat with Mr. Parris about taking ministerial Office."
Nothing was done however at this Meeting towards
effecting a Settlement, and on the 25th of November,
after the Services in the Afternoon, the Audience was
stayed, and by a general Vote, requested Mr. Parris
to take Office. On the 10th of December, 1688, the
Brethren of the Church, sent Lieut. Nath'l Putnam,
Sergeant Fuller, Mr. Joshua Rea, Sen., and Sergeant
Ingersoll, who came, they said, "as Messengers to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>know whether Mr. Parris would accept of Office."
He replied, "y<sup>e</sup> Work was weighty, they should
know in due Time." After this, several came on like
Errands, but as yet, no Proposals of Maintenance
were tendered.</p>

<p>On the 29th of April, 1689, Deacons Nath'l Ingersoll
and Edward Putnam, Daniel Rea, Thomas Fuller,
Jr., and John Tarbell, came to Mr. Parris, from the
meeting House, where there had been a general Meeting
of the Inhabitants, and said, "being the aged
Men had had the Matter of Mr. Parris's Settlement
so long in Hand, and effected nothing, they were desirous
to try what the Younger could do." Upon Mr.
Parris's asking them what their Will was, they answered
"they were sent, by y<sup>e</sup> People to desire him to
take Office, and had concluded to offer him sixty
Pounds for his Salary." Twenty Pounds of which,
was to be in Money, and the Remainder as follows:
Wheat at 4 Shillings per Bushel, Indian Corn at 2
Shillings per Bushel, Barley, Rye and Malt at 3 Shillings
per Bushel, Pork at 2 Pence per. Pound, Beef
at 1½ Pence per. Pound.</p>

<p>The Committee being desirous of a speedy Answer,
Mr. Parris informed them, that he would accept of
their Proposals, provided they would comply with the
following Provisions for his Maintenance: 1st, "When
Money shall be more plenteous, the Money Part to
be paid me, shall accordingly be increased. 2d, Tho'
Corn or like Provisions should arise to a higher Price
than you have set, yet for my own Family Use, I
shall have what is needful, at ye Price now stated;
and so if it fall lower. 3d, The whole sixty Pounds
to be only from our Inhabitants, that are dwelling in
our Bounds, or proportionable to what Lands they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>have, within y<sup>e</sup> same. 4th, No Provision to be
brought in, without just asking whether needed, and
myself to make choice of what, unless ye Person is
unable to pay in any Sort but one. 5th, Fire Wood
to be given in yearly freely. 6th, Two Men to be
chosen yearly to see that due Payments be made.
7th, Contributions each Sabbath in Papers, and only
such as are in Papers, and dwelling within in our
Bounds, to be accounted as Part of the sixty Pounds.
8th, As God shall please to bless y<sup>e</sup> Place, so as to be
able to rise higher, than y<sup>e</sup> said sixty Pounds, that
then a proportionable Increase be made. If God shall
please for our Sins to diminish the Substance of said
Place, I will endeavour accordingly to bear such Losses,
by proportionable Abatements of such as shall reasonably
desire it."</p>

<p>These Proposals of Mr. Parris to the Committee
were read to them and accepted, and they expressed
their Belief, that the Inhabitants would approve of
them. But it would seem that at a Meeting of the
People of the Village, May 17th, 1689, Mr. Parris
was sent for, when Objections were made against the
5th and 7th Provisions of his Settlement. "Touching
the 5th it was objected, they had no Commons,
and therefore could not conveniently give in Fire
Wood, because some must bring in half Cord, others
more, others less, &amp;c. Therefore they would allow
six Pounds per annum, one third Money, which would
buy 30 Cords, as they had dealt by former Ministers."
Parris replied, he was willing to ease them, but then
he desired, that one of them would take the six Pounds
annually, and furnish him with 30 Cords of Wood, to
which Proposal he found none of them willing to
consent. He then told them, if he did accept the six
Pounds, it might in Time be insufficient to purchase
30 Cords of Wood. In reply to the Fears of Parris
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
in regard to the Rise of the Price of Wood, he says,
I had a general Answer from many that at four Shillings
per Cord, I should be supplied during my Life
among them. He continues, after much urging, I
replied I would try them for one Year. Mr. Parris
says: "touching his 7th Provision, nothing at the
Time was said or objected against Contributions by
Papers, for it had been their former usual Way, but
only against those, that dwelled within their Bounds,
they urging that some did not live within their Bounds,
yet they were constant Hearers, and therefore it was
meet to have their Help."</p>

<p>"In fine, after much Agitation here, it was agreed on
my Part and theirs, that such out Persons had Liberty
to please themselves, in paying to the Minister or the
meeting House. And so I left them, fully acquiescing
with my aforesaid Conditions, not doubting but that
they had truly entered it on the Records, as I took
for granted, nor heard any Thing otherwise, till after
my Ordination a good while, in another public Meeting
of the Village; when another Vote, recorded and
read, vastly different from the Agreement, as above
said&mdash;which I then openly did, and still must deny,
to be any Contract of mine."</p>

<p>We have now presented Mr. Parris's Account, of
the Transactions between himself and the People of
Salem Village, in regard to his Settlement. This was
drawn up by him, and used upon his Trial before the
Court of Common Pleas at Ipswich in 1696-7. We
have been thus particular in Relation to the Settlement
of Mr. Parris at Salem Village, it being one of
the Causes, which led to the most bitter parochial
Quarrel, that ever existed in New-England, and in the
Opinion of some Persons, was the chief or primary
Cause of that world-wide famous Delusion, the Salem
Witchcraft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>

Salem Village, since embraced in the Parish of Rev.
Dr. Milton P. Braman, in Danvers, Massachusetts,
was, on the 19th of November, 1689 (when the Rev.
Samuel Parris entered upon his Duties there as a
Pastor and Teacher,) a small Hamlet or Village, inhabited
principally by Farmers, but embracing within
its Limits, much adjoining Territory, extending its
Lines to Wills Hill, now Middleton, there being
many Families who attended Worship at Salem Village.
The number of rateable Polls in the Parish
was 100. It appears, from the Records, that Mr.
Parris presented to his Church, upon his Settlement,
a new Covenant and Form of Admission for its
Members, together with the Question, who were the
proper Subjects of Baptism? These caused some Debate
in the Church, but none opposed the final Action
upon them. Some singular and unusual Cases of
Discipline came before them, but they appeared to
have been disposed of peaceably. It was not until
the 8th of October, 1691, that we discover any unfriendly
feeling, existing between Mr. Parris and his
People. It was on that Day, he says in his Church
Records,&mdash;"Being my Lecture Day after public Service
was ended, I was so bare of Fire Wood, that I
was forced publicly to desire the Inhabitants to take
Care that I might be provided for, telling them, had
it not been for Mr. Corwin (who had brought Wood,
being here at my House), I should hardly have had
any to burn." Upon the Pastor's informing the
Church of his Destitution of Fire Wood, the Brethren
raised a Committee, who were instructed to see
the Town Committee, and desire them to make a
Rate for the Minister. The Committee on Rates
met November 10th, 1691, and reported that they
did not see good Cause to take Notice of the Church
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
Committee, without they had a Letter to show, under
the Church and Pastor's Hand. Upon this, Mr.
Parris complained of the Treatment of the Committee
towards him, but more especially the Church,
whom he said manifested an indifference in this Affair.
The Committee, whose Business it was to raise a Tax
to procure the Pastor's Wood, still continuing to
refuse to do it, on the 27th of December, 1691, a
Petition was sent to the Quarter Sessions, wherein the
Petitioners complain, that "no Reparations of the
Village Meeting House has been for a great while
regarded, so that broken Windows, stopt up some of
them by Boards or otherwise, and others wide open,
and is sometimes so dark, that it is almost <i>unuseful</i>."
The Court, upon this Petition, appointed a Meeting
of the Inhabitants of the Village, to choose a new
Committee to meet on the 25th of January, 1692,
for the Purpose of assessing Rates to repair the meeting
House, and procure the Pastor's Wood. The
Inhabitants of the Village met on that Day, and
made choice of Joseph Pope, Joseph Holten, Jr.,
John Tarbell, Thomas Preston, and James Smith, as
their Committee.</p>

<p>This is the last we hear about this Affair of procuring
Wood, &amp;c., probably all further Consideration
of it was absorbed in the great Witchcraft Delusion,
which was now close at Hand, and about to break
forth.</p>

<p>We are now brought to the Period of the Commencement
of Salem Witchcraft, as it first developed
itself in the Family of Samuel Parris, Minister at
Salem Village in 1692.</p>

<p>Mr. Parris's Household consisted, at this Time, of
himself and Wife, his age being 39 Years, that of his
Wife 44 Years, a Daughter Elizabeth, aged nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
Years, a Niece of eleven Years by the Name of Abigail
Williams, and two Servants named John Indian,
and Tituba his Wife, both Natives of South America,
then called New Spain. These were held as Slaves,
and Parris probably came into possession of them in
some of his Commercial Transactions. By some Persons,
these Indians have been supposed to belong to
the Aborigines of our Country and to have obtained
their knowledge of Witchcraft from the Indian Powows;
but this appears to have been a mistake. Mr.
Parris's nearest Neighbors were Capt. Jona. Walcut,
who had a Daughter called Mary, 17 years of Age,
and his Parish Clerk. Thomas Putnam, who had a
Daughter named Ann, aged 12 Years, and a servant
Girl, living with him, named Mercey Lewis aged 17
Years, Mary Warren, aged 20 Years, lived with John
Proctor, Elizabeth Booth, aged 18 Years, lived near
to John Proctor, Sarah Churchill, aged 20 Years, lived
in the Family of Geo. Jacobs, Sen., Susannah Sheldon,
aged 18 Years, lived in the Village. These Girls, together
with Abigail Williams, a Niece of Mr. Parris,
aged 11 Years, were in the Habit of meeting in a Circle
in the Village, to practice Palmistry, Fortune Telling,
&amp;c. It appears by Evidence, given at the Courts,
that some of their Parents and Guardians did not
approve of these Meetings. Mary Warren, one of
the most Violent of the accusing Girls, lived as we
have before said, with John Proctor, and at last became
his principal Accuser, upon his examination for Witchcraft.
Proctor, out of all Patience with the Meetings
of the Girls, composing this Circle, one Day said he
"was a going to the Village to bring Mary Warren,
the Jade, Home; for, if let alone, these Girls would
make us all <i>Devils and Witches together quickley</i>. They
should rather be had to the Whipping Post; but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
would fetch his Jade Home, and thrash the Devil out
of her." Proctor said, when Mary Warren was first
taken with Fits, he kept her close to the Wheel, and
threatened to thrash her, and then she had no more
Fits; but the next Day, he being gone from Home,
she had her Fits again. If the accusing Girls had
been dealt with as John Proctor would have had them,
we probably should have had a short Story to tell,
about Salem Witchcraft. It is at the Meeting of this
Circle of eight Girls, for the purpose of practising
Palmistry and Fortune Telling, that we discover the
Germ, or the first Origin of the Delusion. We have
endeavored to follow them after the Excitement had
subsided, for the Purpose of ascertaining their Character
in after Life. One only of this Circle, Ann
Putnam, confessed her Folly, and sought Forgiveness.
Some of them grew up Licentious in their Habits,
and all of them appear to have sought Obscurity.
Their whole Course, as seen in their Depositions, discloses
much Malignancy, and their Ignorance was so
great, that of the Eight accusing Girls, Six of them
signed their Names with a Cross.</p>

<p>It was in the latter End of February, 1692, that the
Daughter of Mr. Parris, named Elizabeth, aged 9
Years, together with his Niece, Abigail Williams,
aged 12 Years, were taken Sick and received such attention
from Mrs. Parris as their Case seemed to
require. But growing worse under her Treatment,
and not being able to ascertain what their Disease was,
application was made to their Family Physician, Dr.
Gregg, living in the Village. He visited them, and
observed that they were afflicted with a sad Distemper,
the Name of which he could not tell. Other Physicians
were called in, in Consultation, when one of them
gave it as his Opinion, that the Children were under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
an evil Hand. It is probable that it was Dr. Gregg that
supposed the Girls bewitched, for he had expressed the
same Opinion of many of his Patients when he could
not understand their Disease, many times before. It
is highly probable that the Opinion of these Physicians
went far to form the Belief of not only Parris, but
also of his ministerial Friends, in the Existence of
Witchcraft in the Village. Mr. Parris appears to
have been much astonished, when the Physicians informed
him, that his Daughter and Niece were, no
doubt, under an evil Hand. There is Evidence that
Mr. Parris endeavored to keep the Opinion of the
Physicians a Secret, at least, till he could determine
what Course to pursue. At this Time, Mary Sibley,
a Member of his Church, gave directions to John
Indian how to find out, who bewitched Betsy Parris
and Nabby Williams. This was done without the
Knowledge of Parris. The Means used to make this
Discovery, was to make a Cake of Rye Meal, with
the Urine of the Children, and Bake it in the Ashes,
and give it to a Dog to eat. Similar disgusting
Practices appear to have been used to discover and
kill Witches, during the whole Period of the Delusion.</p>

<p>On the 27th of March, 1692, Mr. Parris called together
his Church, when he presented Testimony against
the Error of sister Mary Sibley, in giving direction to
John Indian in an unwarrantable Way, to find out
Witches. Upon Mary Sibley's manifesting Sorrow
and Grief for her Conduct, the Brethren of the Church
received Satisfaction. By the diabolical Means thus
used by Mary Sibley, Mr. Parris supposed the Devil
had been raised, and seeing the apparent distressed
Condition of his Family, and not knowing what
Course to pursue, requested some worthy Gentlemen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
Salem, and some neighboring Ministers to consult together
at his House; who when they came, and had
inquired diligently into the Sufferings of the Afflicted,
concluded they were Preternatural, and feared the
Hand of Satan was in them. The Advice given to
Parris by them was, that he should sit still and wait
upon the Providence of God, to see what Time might
discover; and to be much in Prayer for the Discovery
of what was yet secret. They also examined Tituba,
who confessed the making a Cake, and said her Mistress
in her own Country was a Witch, and had taught
her some Means to be used for the Discovery of a
Witch, and for the Prevention of being bewitched,
&amp;c. But said she herself, was not a Witch. Soon
after this, there were two or three private Fasts at
Parris's House, one of which was kept by the neighboring
Ministers, and another in Public at the Village.
And one general Fast, by Order of the General Court,
observed throughout the Colony, to seek the Lord,
that he would rebuke Satan, and be a Light unto his
People in this Day of Darkness.</p>

<p>It is evident from the Account given by Rev. John
Hale, who was an Eye Witness to many of the
Transactions at Salem Village, and one of the Ministers
called for Consultation, that Mr. Parris proceeded
with Caution at the Commencement of the Troubles,
and was anxious to seek Council and Advice. He
likewise wished to inform himself on the Subject of
Witchcraft, and for that Purpose received as a Loan
from Dea. Robert Sanderson, of Boston, a Copy of
Perkins' Works, which treated upon that Subject.</p>

<p>We are among those who believe Mr. Parris was
honest in his Belief in Witchcraft, and that he was not
moved in this Affair by personal Malice, or the Desire
to promote the Cause of Religion in his Parish, as has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
been supposed by the Author of the History of Danvers.
We have not as yet, found a Particle of Evidence,
that he entertained ill Will against those who
were accused and executed.</p>

<p>Mr. Parris, in common with his ministerial Brethren,
appears to have come, after the Confession of
Tituba, to the full Conclusion, that Witchcraft had
broken out in his Parish, and that the Devil had commenced
his Operations in his own Family; and as a
faithful Pastor, he should not hesitate, for a Moment,
to grapple with the Enemy.</p>

<p>It was in this Point of View, that we discover the
Courage of the People of Salem Village, who were
engaged in opposing what they considered the Machinations
of the Devil&mdash;they supposing that he was the
Cause, operating through the Agency of Witches, of
all the Torture and Misery they beheld, and that, by
their Opposition, they were liable also to suffer from
his Malignancy. They believed, also, that the Devil
was about to establish an Agency, or Kingdom in
New England; and had actually commenced Operations
in Salem Village. This, Cotton Mather, Parris,
and others, were determined should not be done, at
least if they could help it. There was some very
singular Evidence given at the Courts on this Point.
Ann Foster, of Andover, a confessing Witch, testified
at her Examination, July 21, 1692, "that she was at a
Witch Meeting at the Village, where there was a large
Number of Witches present, and that the principal
Discourse at this Gathering, was in regard to the setting
up of the Devil's Kingdom at the Village, and
making it their Rendezvous!" And another confessing
Witch testified, at a subsequent Meeting, that
they had, by an unanimous Vote, concluded to set up
the Devil's Kingdom at Salem Village&mdash;it being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
thought, all Things considered, the most suitable Place
to begin the Enterprise, and, by so doing, they were
in Hopes it would spread over New England. This
was solemnly and religiously believed by many, and it
required Courage and Pluck to stand up and resist the
Designs of a powerful, malicious Being, capable, as
they supposed, of tormenting them in various Ways,
destroying their Cattle, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Parris appears to have been very desirous of preventing
his Daughter, Elizabeth, from participating in
the Excitement at the Village. She was sent by her
Father, at the Commencement of the Delusion, to
reside at Salem with Capt. Stephen Sewall. While
there, the Captain and his Wife were much discouraged
in effecting a Cure, as she continued to have sore Fits.
Elizabeth said that the great <i>black Man</i>, came to her, and
told her, if she would be ruled by him, she should
have whatsoever she desired, and go to a <i>Golden City</i>.
She related this to Mrs. Sewall, who immediately told
the Child it was the Devil, and he was a Liar, and bid
her tell him so if he came to her again; which she did
accordingly the next Time the black Man came to
her. The Devil, it would seem, unaccustomed, in
those Days, to experience such Resistance, and utterly
astonished at the cool Impudence of Betsy Parris,
never troubled her afterwards; and,&mdash;although this
Girl was one of the first Originators of the Witchcraft
Delusion, in connection with her Cousin Abigail Williams,&mdash;she
appears to have had, afterwards, but little
to do with Witchcraft. This arose in Consequence of
following the sage Advice of Mrs. Sewall, in getting
rid of the Devil; or, what was more probable, in her
Father taking her from the weekly Circle of accusing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
and bewitching Girls, and placing her in a very respectable
Family in Salem.</p>

<p>It has been said that Parris had a Rival in Rev.
George Burroughs, who had Friends in Salem Village,
desirous of his Settlement; and that that was a sufficient
Reason why Parris should appear at the Courts
against him. We have never seen any Proof of this
Rivalship between these Clergymen. It is difficult now
to ascertain the Cause of the Arrest of Burroughs who
was preaching at Wells, at the Time, in his Pulpit.
The Girl who accused him of bewitching her, was
Mercy Lewis, who was then living with Thomas
Putnam. She formerly lived with Burroughs, when
he preached at the Village; and, upon one or more
Occasions, he whipped her severely. This we suspect
was the true Cause of her crying out against him.</p>

<p>It had been said that Rebecca Nurse was an Object
of special Hatred to Parris; but this we have failed to
discover. We cannot imagine the Cause of the alleged
Complaint of Witchcraft against Rebecca Nurse.
She appears to have been an amiable and exemplary
Woman, and well educated for the Times in which
she lived. We suspect, from an Examination of the
Charges brought against her at the Courts, that she had
several Times severely rebuked the accusing Girls for
their Folly and Wickedness, when meeting in their Circles.
In this Way, she probably incurred the Displeasure
of Ann Putnam and her Mother&mdash;her principal
Accusers. Mr. Parris has often been accused
of being over Officious, and a swift Witness against
the Accused at the Courts. Parris could not be said to
have been a chief Witness in the Prosecutions, although
he may be said to have been a frequent corroborating
Witness with his Neighbors. The chief Witnesses
were the accusing Girls, as they were called. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
preliminary Examinations before the Magistrates, Parris
and others were required to be present when the
Depositions were taken down, as related by the Girls,
and afterwards made use of at the Trials before the
Courts.</p>

<p>These being given in and related by Children, and
young Persons, the Court required an Endorsement
from some older Persons, who witnessed their supposed
Afflictions, and could attest to their Depositions. It
is in this Way Mr. Parris's Name, as well as his
Neighbors, frequently appear in the Court Documents.
Parris appears to have been frequently at the Examinations
of those accused of Witchcraft, and put Questions
to those on Trial. He also acted as a Recorder
to the Magistrates more frequently than others. The
Reason for his being often employed by the Courts
was simply because he was requested to do so, and was
discovered to be well qualified for that Purpose. We
have seen the Records of several Persons thus employed,
and should say Parris's was the Best. It
was his Practice to take down the Examinations in
short Hand,&mdash;he being a good Stenographer,&mdash;and
then write them out in full, in a plain, legible Hand.</p>

<p>We have not been able to discover the Cause of the
alleged Complaint of Witchcraft, against those three
excellent Women, viz: Rebecca Nurse, Mary Easty,
and Sarah Cloyce. They were Sisters, of a good Education,
and fair Reputation. It is not to be denied,
that the Part Parris took in the Trials of these Women,
was the chief Cause of the Opposition towards
him, and led at last to his Dismission from the People
at the Village. His principal Opposers were the
Relatives of these three unfortunate Sisters. Samuel
Nurse, a Son of Rebecca Nurse, John Tarbell, who
had married her Daughter, and Peter Cloyce, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
married Sarah Cloyce. These three Persons, together
with one Thomas Williams, after the Execution of
Rebecca Nurse and Mary Easty, and the Imprisonment
of Sarah Cloyce, became much dissatisfied with
Parris, and sought Advice of the Elders in some of
the neighboring Churches, as to the best Mode of
bringing him before a Council to answer for his Conduct
in the Witchcraft Delusion. They were Members
of the Village Church, and had for some Time
neglected Public Worship on the Sabbath, and absented
themselves from the Communion. While these discontented
Brethren were considering what Course to
pursue against their Pastor, Parris, either in order to
divert their Proceedings from himself, or to administer
Discipline, on the 14th of August, 1692, caused the
Church to be stayed, and entered a Complaint against
Samuel Nurse and Wife, John Tarbell and Wife, and
Peter Cloyce, for absenting themselves from the Communion.
This Complaint was entered by the Church,
and Brother Nathaniel Putnam, and the two Deacons
were chosen to be joined with the Pastor to discourse
with the Absentees. Much Time was spent by this
Committee, in endeavoring to obtain Satisfaction from
the offending Brethren;&mdash;while on the other Hand,
they were striving by all the Means in their Power, to
bring Parris before a Council. At last, on the 16th of
February, 1693, at a Meeting of the Committee of the
Church, the Dissenting Brethren gave their Reasons
for withdrawing from the Communion.</p>

<p>"Whereas we, Thomas Williams, and John Tarbell,
and Samuel Nurse, having a long Time gone
under the Burden of great Grievances, by Reason of
some unwarrantable Actings of Mr. Parris, as we
esteem them, and were proceeding in an orderly Way,
to obtain Satisfaction from him, and had taken some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
Steps thereunto, according to the Advice of some
neighboring Elders. But obstructive to our Proceedings
therein, Mr. Parris and some Brethren of the
Church, were appointed by the Church, to demand a
Reason of us, of our withdrawing from Communion.
The Regularity of which Proceeding, we do not understand,
because in this Case, we esteem ourselves to
be Plaintiffs and Parties offended, and in an orderly
Way, seeking Satisfaction, tho' hitherto denied. Our
Answer to the Church is, that we esteem ourselves
hereby prevented in our Duty, which we account a
Grievance, seeing we were first in Prosecution of the
Rule of our Lord Jesus Christ, laid down in Mathew
18 C., 15, 16 vs. Wherefore, if the Church give us
the Liberty and Freedom of attending our Duty, as
according to Rule bound, possibly then further Trouble
may be prevented, or otherwise, the Case will necessarily
and regularly come before them. But if they
deny us the Request, we shall, as in Duty bound, give
the Reasons of our Proceedings to the Church, or any
others, when orderly demanded."</p>

<p>Parris says, in the Records of the Church, "that
these displeased Brethren were told in Reply to their
Communication, that they did ill to reflect on the
Church, who, as also the Pastor, were ignorant of their
Methods, and that they should have spoken with the
Pastor himself, before they went to consult neighboring
Elders. But to this Last they pleaded Ignorance. So
we gave Way to their Request of proceeding orderly."</p>

<p>On the 27th of March, 1693, the dissenting Brethren
handed to the Pastor the following Document:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To our Pastor and Minister, Mr. Samuel Parris,
of Salem Village, and to some others of the Plantation.
We, whose Names are underwritten, being
deeply sensible, that those uncomfortable Differences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
that are amongst us, are very dishonorable to God, and
a Scandal to Religion, and very uncomfortable to ourselves,
and an ill Example to those, who may come
after us. And by our maintaining and upholding
Differences, that are amongst us, we do but gratify
the Devil, the great Adversary to our Souls. For the
Removal of which we have thought meet to proffer
our present Thoughts to your serious Consideration,
hoping, that there may be such Methods propounded,
as may be for the settling and confirming Peace and
Unity amongst us, both at the Present and for the
Future. And our Desires are, that such a Foundation
may be laid for Peace and Truth, that the Gates
of Hell may not prevail against it. And in Order
thereunto, Solomon adviseth Counsel; and our Desires
are, that a Council of Elders may be chosen, to
hear all our Grievances between Mr. Parris and us,
and determine where the blameable Cause is. And
we hope, that their Wisdom and Prudence may direct
us to such a Method, as may be for our Comfort for
both Present and Future."</p>

<p>Much Time was spent by the Committee of the
Church, in endeavoring to obtain Satisfaction from
the dissenting Brethren, while the Latter were striving
by all the Means in their Power, to bring Parris before
a Council. At last, on the 16th of February,
1693, at a Meeting of the Committee, the dissenting
Brethren gave their Reasons for withdrawing from the
Ministry at the Village. They are the following.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>After the Pastor had read the Charges against him,
he brought forward his "Meditations for Peace."
This Paper, having been considered at the Time as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>an Acknowledgment of his Mistakes in the Witchcraft
Delusion, we have given it entire. It is as follows.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the discontented Brethren continued
to press the Acceptance of their Petition, for a
mutual Council. Parris refused to notice it, and says,
"I put it up in my Pocket, and told them I would
consider it." It appears, by the Records, that the
Acknowledgment of Mr. Parris was first read before
the Church, November, 18, 1694, in the Presence of
the dissenting Brethren, when Tarbell remarked, that
if the Pastor had formerly made but <i>half the Acknowledgment
he now had</i>, it had never come to this. It
would seem that the Acknowledgment of the Pastor
was not satisfactory to the Brethren, and they continued
to persist in the calling of a Council. In the
Meantime, Parris brought sundry Objections, as he
called them, against Tarbell and his Friends, which
were read before the Church, November 13th. These
Objections, were as follows:&mdash;"Their precipitant,
schismatical and total withdrawing from the Church;
Their bringing forward a factious Libel to the Pastor,
consisting of Calumnies, or Reflections on said Minister,
and others of the Plantation; their impetuous
Pursuit of the Minister at his House, for Answer to
said Libel to his great Disquietude; there restless
Pursuit of the Minister, on the 14th of April, 1693,
for an Answer to said Libel; their persisting with
great Heat, that their Charge might be read, yea
loudly and fiercely before the whole Brotherhood,
clamouring against the Church, and their publishing
under their own Hands, in divers Places of the
Country, sundry Obloquies against the Church; their
ensnaring several to join them in a Petition to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>Excellency and General Court, scandalizing the Church
and Minister, as unpeaceable with their Neighbors;
their withdrawing their Purses, as well as their Persons
from upholding the Lord's Table, and the Ministry;
their gross Mistake in their Letter to the Church at
Malden, wherein they profess so much Dissatisfaction
with the Doctrine, Practice and Administration of
their Pastor, for above a Year, before the Date of said
Letter, as that they were forced to withdraw from all
public Worship; whereas it is most notorious, that
they were not wanting as to a Profession of much Respect
to their Pastor, all along before, yea, and a considerable
while after the breaking out of the late horrid
Witchcraft." These are some of the Charges brought
against the three Brethren by Parris, and he informs
us, "as soon as the public Reading of these Articles
was ended, Brother Thomas Wilkins, in a scoffing
and contemptuous Way, said openly, 'this is a large
Epistle.'" It would seem by the Records, that the
dissenting Brethren continued to make strenuous Efforts
to bring Parris before a Council, which was at
last recommended by the Pastors of the Churches in
the Neighborhood, when Parris in his last Attempt to
evade it, proposed to give the discontented Brethren,
a Dismission to some other orthodox Church, to which
Tarbell replied, "Aye, if we could find a Way to
remove our Living too." After a Delay of more
than two Years, the Church consented to call a Council,
who met at the Village, April 3d, 1695. Dr. Increase
Mather was chosen Moderator, and offered the
following Report, which was accepted by the Council,
and presented to the Church:&mdash;1st, They unanimously
declared that "we judge that altho' in the late and
dark Time of the Confusions, wherein Satan had obtained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
a more than ordinary Liberty to sift this Plantation,
there were sundry unwarrantable and uncomfortable
Steps taken, by Mr. Samuel Parris, the Pastor of
the Church in Salem Village, then under the hurrying
Distractions of amazing Afflictions; yet the said Mr. Parris,
by the good Hand of God, brought unto a better
Sense of Things, hath so fully expressed it, that a Christian
Charity may, and should, receive Satisfaction therewith.
2, They advised the dissenting Brethren to accept
the Satisfaction, which he had tendered in his Christian
Acknowledgment of the Errors therein committed,
and in case Mr. Parris finds after all, that he can not
with any Comfort and Service, continue in his present
Station, his Removal from thence, will not expose him
to any hard Character with us. Having observed that
there is, in Salem Village, a Spirit full of Contention
and Animosity, too sadly verifying the Blemish, which
hath heretofore lain upon them; and that some Complaints
against Mr. Parris have been either causeless
or groundless, or unduly aggravated, we do, in the
Name and Fear of the Lord, solemnly warn them to
consider whether, if they continue to devoure one
another, it will not be Bitterness in the latter End."</p>

<p>The Recommendation of the Council appears to
have been satisfactory to the Friends of Mr. Parris
and the Pastor was resolved to continue in the Ministry.
At the same Time, the Report of the Council
was unsatisfactory to those Persons opposed to Mr.
Parris, as it did not recommend his Dismission; accordingly,
on the 3d Day of May, 1695, a Paper,
signed by 16 young Men, 52 Householders and 18
Church Members, was handed to the Rev. Elders,
composing the late Council at the Village, requesting
them to give Parris's Case a rehearing, and more
plainly advise the Pastor to cease his Labors, and seek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
to dispose himself elsewhere, &amp;c. On the 6th of May,
1695, in Answer to the Opponents of Mr. Parris, the
Council sent a Letter to the Pastor, informing him of
the Extent of the Opposition to his Ministry, and
advising him to come away from his present Station,
and unite in calling another Minister, and forgiving
and forgetting all former Grievances.</p>

<p>Mr. Parris appears to have been nettled with the last
Recommendation of the Council for him to leave his
Parish, and says, in the Church Records, under his
own Hand, that the Paper (in Answer to the Instrument
and <i>classical</i> Letter from Cambridge) was brought
by Deacon Putnam to the Elders, assembled at Boston,
at Mr. Willard's, May 29th, 1695, being the Day of
Election after Dinner, when was assembled the Body
of Elders, belonging to this Province. This Paper
was addressed to the Rev. Mr. Increase Mather and
others of the Rev. Elders, which lately met at Cambridge,
under Date of May 20th, 1695, and signed by
53 Householders and 52 Church members, all belonging
to Salem Village. In this Letter, they say, that
the Removing of Mr. Parris from his present Station
will not unite us in calling another Minister. That
they justly fear, should he be removed, they would
be left, as a Sheep, without a Shepherd. Therefore
they desire, that Mr. Parris may continue in his present
Station.</p>

<p>The Council appear to have been at last fully satisfied
that Mr. Parris should leave Salem Village, and
they therefore procured a Parish for him in Suffield,
and sent two Messengers from that Church, to
persuade the Church at Salem Village to dismiss their
Pastor. Parris informs us, in his Church Records,
that at a Meeting of the Church, held at his House,
June 3d, 1695, he acquainted the Brethren, that here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
were two Messengers from Suffield, who were looking
out for a Minister, and by the Desire of some Elders
in Boston, made application to him, and was willing
to go with them, if the Brethren pleased, and in his
Absence for a few Months, they might try if they could
(with others who now dissented,) unite in some other
Minister. But, after several Hours debate, both with
the Brethren, and some other Christian Neighbors,
they all declared an Averseness to his Motion. Thereupon
thanking them for their professed Love to him,
he told them, he was not free to go, without their Consent,
and seeing they would not let him go, he prayed for
them <i>to keep him, and make much of him</i>. The same Day,
June 3d, 1695, the Church sent the following decisive
Letter to Rev. Increase and Cotton Mather,
saying, "we cannot fault ye Intendment of our Brethren
Sergent David Winchell, and Corporal Victory Sikes,
Messengers from Suffield, sent by yourselves to obtain
the Ministry of our Pastor if we were so minded, as
to part with him. But upon maturing together, this
Day both of Church and others, to consult that Affair,
do hereby signify at the Desire of the above Suffield
Messengers, with unanimous Agreement, not one excepted&mdash;(save
the Four known Dissenters) we are
resolved&mdash;<i>God helping against such a Separation during
our ability to prevent it</i>. And our Pastor tho' otherwise
inclined, yet as unwilling to leave so many of his
Flock, as testify so strong Affections towards him. So
earnestly requesting the constant Helps of your Prayers,
and as much otherwise as you can, we rest, worthy and
much esteemed Sirs, your needy Brethren.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Samuel Parris</span>, Pastor,</p>
<p class="in2">in the Name of the Church and other Christian
Neighbors.</p>
<ul>
<li>To the Rev. Mr. Increase Mather and</li>
<li>Mr. Cotton Mather, Jun., Boston."</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
It does not appear that there were any more Efforts
made by the Boston Elders, to bring about a Reconciliation;
and it seems that there was always a Majority
of the Parish in Favor of Mr. Parris, remaining
with them; and there appears to have been a very
general Mistake, with many Authors, in Regard to his
Dismission from his People, they, supposing that he
was hastily driven away from the Village. Whereas
he continued and maintained himself through a ministerial
Quarrel of five Years, until he saw fit to discontinue
it, when he informed his Church of his
Intentions.</p>

<p>There were three distinct Matters of Dispute between
Parris and his People at Salem Village. The First
arose previous to the Breaking out of the Witchcraft
Delusion, in Consequence of the Neglect of his Parish
to furnish him with the stipulated Supply of 30 Cords
of Wood per Annum. The second Dispute with the
four Dissenting Brethren of the Church, arose in Consequence
of the Course pursued by Parris in Regard to
Witchcraft. The Third, was in Consequence of his
claiming the Parsonage and Lands, under a vote of the
Inhabitants of the Village, and their Refusing to pay
him his Arrears due him, on his old Lists of Rates.
These three Disputes, caused a long and continued
Quarrel, which at last attracted the People far and
near&mdash;was a grave Matter for learned Councils, was
brought before the County Courts, and was a Subject
for Petition before the great and General Court at
Boston. After it was understood that Parris was to
leave the People at the Village, and that he claimed
the Parsonage, a fierce Quarrel arose between him and
the Inhabitants, which was carried before the Court at
Ipswich.</p>

<p>The Matter, without being settled, was taken from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
the Courts, and given to Wait Winthrop, Elisha Cook,
and Samuel Sewall, Esqrs., and they decided "that
Mr. Parris should have some of his Arrears paid him,
also a sum of Money for his Repairs of the ministerial
House, and be dismissed from Salem Village."</p>

<p>It was during his greatest Difficulties with his People,
that he lost his Wife by Death. This occurred
on the 14th of July, 1696. She was buried in the
Wadsworth burial Ground, in Danvers, where can be
seen a gray Slate Stone,&mdash;a fine Specimen of the lapidary
Art,&mdash;with its Lines as sharp as on the Day
when they were first cut, erected over her Grave, on
which is the following Inscription, with the Initials of
Samuel Parris at the Bottom:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Sleep precious Dust, no stranger now to Rest,</div>
<div class="i0">Thou hast thy longed wish, within Abraham's Brest&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">Farwell Best Wife, Choice Mother, Neighbor, Friend,</div>
<div class="i0">We'll wail the less, for hopes of the in the end."</div>
<div class="right"><small>S. P.</small> </div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>After his Dismission from Salem Village he removed
to Concord, Massachusetts, where he lived in
1705; and 1711, preached six Months in Dunstable.
He died at Sudbury, February 27th, 1720; Mrs.
Dorothy Parris, his second Wife, died there on the 6th
of September, 1719. The following are the Children
of Mr. Parris:&mdash;Elizabeth, who was married to Benj.
Barnes, at Concord, January 13th, 1710; Dorothy,
married Hopestill Brown, of Sudbury, 1718, and
died March 4th, 1725; Samuel, who was a Deacon of
a Church in Sudbury, died November 22d, 1792,
aged 91 Years; Noyes, graduated at Harvard College,
1721, was deranged, and supported by the Town;
Mary, married Peter Bent, of Sudbury, April 18th,
1727.</p>

<h2>NOTE BY THE EDITOR.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">WHEN this Edition of the <i>More Wonders</i> had passed through the
Press, the Publisher brought in the following <span class="smcap">Errata</span>, which, it
seems, had been inserted in some Copies of the original Edition; and,
although several of the Errors are quite immaterial, and others have been
corrected in the Process of Revision, yet it was thought best to insert it
here entire.</p>

<p>Mr. Woodward informs the Editor, that he copied it from a Copy of
Mr. Calef's Work in the Library of the Massachusetts Hist. Society,
which once belonged to Dr. <span class="smcap">Cotton Mather</span>, and afterwards to Dr.
Jeremy Belknap. Hence it is very probable that this Copy was presented
to Dr. Mather by the Author. However this may have been,
the following Extract, written in Dr. Mather's own Hand in the same
Volume, seems odd indeed:</p>

<p>"Job, xxxi, 35, 36. My Desire is, <i>that</i> mine Adversary had written
a Book. Surely I would take it upon my Shoulder, and bind it as a
Crown to me."</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
